I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intro music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have with me Alex Kirk, who is a longtime WordPress contributor and who has been instrumental in recent innovations in the Polyglots&#8217; work. Phase four of the Gutenberg project is native multilingual support, and so I see this work that is being done as instrumental, not only for our global community but in support of what&#8217;s to come in that specific roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado, Alex Kirk, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, how are you doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. Can you, let&#8217;s, because I bet that not a lot of people know who you are, can you first start by just telling me a bit about your work with WordPress, and then let us know what GlotPress is, for those of us who don&#8217;t know yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, Automattic sponsors me to work in the WordPress project on the Meta team and on the Polyglots team. So I spent time on improving or helping improve the software that powers the translation on WordPress.org. But I also work on the meta team on things like Matrix and evaluating if it would be a good fit for WordPress to switch to Matrix for their chat system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of really big projects that you work on, all of that kind of stuff that has no easy solutions anymore, is where you are right now. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no clear path, but it&#8217;s our mission to find it. So that&#8217;s part of what makes things interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So for folks who don&#8217;t know too much about the Polyglots team or generally translating WordPress, the software, can you let us know a bit about what GlotPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:02:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the translation system that powers WordPress.org is called GlotPress. It used to be a standalone software that was developed a couple of years ago, and it was transformed into a WordPress plugin at some point, and now powers the translation that happens on WordPress.org. So we translate WordPress core there from English to other languages, plugins, themes, block patterns, and it all happens through this software called GlotPress. There are a couple GlotPress installations around the world, but I think the WordPress.org one is one of the bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably, WordPress.org is pretty, pretty massive. Also, I think it&#8217;s great that you said that GlotPress was created a couple of years ago, like that, that indicates to me that you&#8217;re working on a really different timescale than a lot of folks are in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:03:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Alex, tell me a little bit about what it takes to ship translated WordPress software. So, I mean, for people who don&#8217;t need translated WordPress, like obviously we don&#8217;t have a good idea of what it takes to make sure that WordPress is available in so many languages. So what goes into the work of making sure that that happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so typically the WordPress software and plugins and themes are primarily created in English. And for it to be available in other languages, it needs to be translated. And for that to be able to happen, the programmers need to make the software translatable. Basically, they&#8217;re providing each English string for the translation software to be available to be transformed, so to speak, into another language and to what it&#8217;s being transformed to. This is what the translators do. So they go into the GlotPress software and see the list of texts that need to be translated and translate it to their language that they speak. Typically there is a process around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got people who have lots of experience in translation. And specifically in translating WordPress or WordPress plugins. And they&#8217;re kind of the, the people who help ensure good quality of translation. So anybody who&#8217;s working the WordPress project, so basically who has a WordPress.org account, can come in and address the translation. And that translation enters the system, so to speak, in a waiting state. And then somebody who we promoted to be a Translation Editor will come along and take a look at your translation and will approve it or will give you suggestions how to do the translation in a better way, or come up with maybe even a better translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, when you have like a small thing that&#8217;s just not right, like a missing full stop or something like that. They might just add it for you. And well, as soon as the plugin or software is translated to a certain level of translations those translations will be shipped out to the WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, for a plugin, you would reach 90% of translated strings. Those translations will then be basically packed up into zip file, a language pack and delivered to each WordPress so that you can have the translations available there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is 90% the threshold for plugins only, or is that also the threshold for like themes and the CMS itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well. We strive for 100%, I would say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. <em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:48]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, 90% more of a motivational point. To be actually honest, I&#8217;m not sure if the threshold is 90% for every project or even if it&#8217;s actually 90%. It&#8217;s different between different GlotPress installations and it&#8217;s basically something that is made as a setting that can be changed. There&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an arbitrary number. Typically you&#8217;d actually want to make sure that the most important strings are translated first. So the ones like, if you look at the whole picture, software usually consists of many parts, many of whom are not encountered by people on a regular basis. For example, error messages that could be like obscure error messages, and you could argue that those might be not as important. Or even sometimes you could even say like, do they need to be translated? Because if you encounter an error message and you search the internet, wouldn&#8217;t you probably want everybody to search for the English one to find the solution? But that set-aside, it&#8217;s important to have like the headline of the plugin or like the most important strings translated, and typically translating those most important strings will take you to a pretty high percentage so that we can then say it&#8217;s good enough to be shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha. I see, I see. Okay. Well, we talked a bit earlier about GlotPress&#8217;s timeline. It has been around for a bit, I know. But with that kind of in mind, have there been any notable changes to GlotPress recently?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think for GlotPress there&#8217;s been a bit of an up and down over time in terms of engagement and progress on the software. But in, in the recent year, I think we&#8217;ve added a couple of things that have been very helpful for translators. So one of them was adding the commenting functionality, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super helpful. Shocked it wasn&#8217;t there before. Sorry, translators. Sorry, all of our polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can be like there was when GlotPress was created there, there is like the, a big part of GlotPress are these states, like the waiting state when you enter translation, and then there&#8217;s approved state, which basically a translation we say it&#8217;s set to current, and there&#8217;s all sorts of process around it. So if the software is updated or translation might get fuzzy. But also like, if somebody submits a translation that doesn&#8217;t fully conform to what&#8217;s the translation editors, or like what the standards of the translation community have been set to, then you would have to need to reject it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that we felt wasn&#8217;t a very good and enticing way of telling people like, we appreciate your work. It wasn&#8217;t just quite right, but it&#8217;s more of a rejection. So this is how we came up with this like, let&#8217;s give people the option to say what was wrong and give them a chance to try again without making them feel rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Sort of a &#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221; as opposed to a, just refusal to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other things that we&#8217;ve worked on is, like, with the recent search of AI, like getting help from AI on translation and also on reviews. So, there&#8217;s some interesting things that you can do with AI in that regard; that one important aspect of translations, it&#8217;s also that we&#8217;ve got glossaries for each language where people, basically the translation community, identifies certain words they want to translate them the same way every time.&nbsp;And with the AI, you can basically add to the prompt, like, please translate those words to those translations when you give me a translation for that. And as it can change over time, you can always adapt this to the prompt, and that has been proven quite helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:09:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is great. That&#8217;s one of those things I know that AI has been like a really popular thing to talk about. And AI, specifically for translations, I think has caused some concern that maybe we&#8217;ll just like translate it all and hope that computers get it right when we know pretty certainly that computers don&#8217;t always get the translations right. But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, right? What you&#8217;re suggesting is that AI would suggest what could be translated and what it could be translated to, and then human beings have to confirm that that&#8217;s correct, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:09:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly it. So basically, we give suggestions to the translators, and then they can modify a translation before they press save. It&#8217;s more of a, like supporting them in getting the translations, like looking up words more quickly and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:10:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s wonderful. So is that the major sort of next step that is coming for GlotPress, or are there other things that we should keep an eye out for in that software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:10:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one direction that we&#8217;ve been taking GlotPress is basically making use of the fact that GlotPress is WordPress plugin now. And you know, typically, you would just use a GlotPress install. So on WordPress.Org, there&#8217;s like GlotPress installed, there&#8217;s translation projects created, something that we call &#8220;translation sets&#8221;. So for languages, you want to translate it to, it&#8217;s all pre-configured, and if you would install GlotPress to plugin on your own WordPress, it would be empty and not very useful. So what we&#8217;ve added is a way for you to basically be able to translate the plugins and themes that you&#8217;ve got installed in your WordPress into the language that you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might have a non-English website that you want to use certain plugins with, and they might not be fully translated at this point, so obviously, you could go to WordPress.org and help translate them, and that&#8217;s the way to, that&#8217;s preferred. But you could also now go install GlotPress on your own website and translate there. And then you have the translations there right when you enter them. And you can then contribute those translations back to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:11:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s with local GlotPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that we call local GlotPress. And you know, since we then have all these translations in the local database, it means we can do even more with those translations. So typically, language packs would be delivered to WordPress, but with local GlotPress, you&#8217;ve got like all the GlotPress software there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can do things like inline translation. So, on your own WordPress and wp-admin, for example, we can highlight all the strings that can be translated, and those strings just have to right-click them and enter your translation, and that way, you can basically go about and translate the whole ui, seeing your progress, as you&#8217;re making, basically turning the screen from red to green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:12:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s something now that you can do in your local WordPress installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:12:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s completely independent of WordPress.org. We would ask you to contribute the translations back when you have them, but being independent also allows you to translate like premium plugins, which could not be hosted on WordPress.org or doing something like that we call like hyper-local translation. So, for example, I speak Austrian German natively, but even inside Austria, we&#8217;ve got different dialects or like special words that we use. And if I wanted to create a website that&#8217;s targeted at the Viennese market, for example, I might want to use those specific terms. And this is something I would have to argue for those translations to be accepted on WordPress.org because it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s like a very targeted market. But if I have a local GlotPress, I can do those translations there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems awfully beneficial, especially as dialects. I&#8217;ve been having these conversations. I have, in my extended family, many children, and they are all learning languages and one of them has been having kind of thoughts about, like, dialects and how dialects are almost another language. And if so, like how do you know what everybody&#8217;s saying when you&#8217;re speaking all the same thing, but it&#8217;s kind of a little bit it sounds a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly a thing in the US, the distinct dialects across our country. And so I imagine that that&#8217;s gonna be a really beneficial sort of implementation for countries that have a lot of different regional variations and certainly smaller countries that have technically the same language as somebody else, but a lot of regional differences, regional specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:14:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same or different as the live translations, Translate Live, that we talked about at the WordCamp Europe a couple weeks back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:14:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, Translate Live is kind of the next step after local GlotPress. It&#8217;s like this happy marriage between the WordPress Playground and local GlotPress. So the WordPress Playground is also something that has come up a lot. It&#8217;s basically a way for you to run WordPress inside a browser window, so in JavaScript. And at first, it seems like mildly interesting, I would say. But when you combine it with other things like local GlotPress, it can lead to really interesting opportunities. So with inline translation, for example, on WordPress.org, you would typically find for every plugin, the UI would look the same. You would have a table of strings, and all that makes you realize you&#8217;re translating this certain plugin is that in the header of the page, it says this name of the plugin, but other than that, it can look really all the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, with WordPress Playground, you can put up a WordPress and run this plugin inside that Playground. And now, if you add local GlotPress to the picture, you can also do the inline translation of that plugin inside the WordPress Playground. So you&#8217;ve got inline translation. We add the glossary so they do make sure that you translate things the same way that they&#8217;re expected, and you don&#8217;t have to install the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, you can see what the translations will look like. You can see the strings next to each other, and what I think is most important, you will start with the strings that you see first, which are the most important ones. When you&#8217;re in the table view, those strings might be somewhere buried in the middle, and yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to see progress if you start with kind of obscure error messages, for example, versus just starting with the things that you see first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:16:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, moving translations away from table-based translations where you kind of have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. So the Translate Live, along with local GlotPress, along with WP Playground, is going to make it so that it&#8217;s easier to see visually what needs to be translated, where, what&#8217;s most valuable to translate for your mid users and your end users, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:16:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and also like for plug-in authors, it can be really good to see, you know, you can switch the languages in the Playground to another language, and you can quickly see like what&#8217;s the state of the translation in this language or in that language. And even things like, you know, Arabic as an RTL language rights to left language. The sidebar will change to the right, and you can also just switch language and see like, what&#8217;s my plugin like in this environment. I mean, this is not technically something that&#8217;s related to local GlotPress, but in this translation live ui, it&#8217;s very easy to change languages and see your plugin in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not specifically related to, to Translations Live, but also, I think that if we&#8217;re saying that WordPress not necessarily is going to lead the way with translations and native multilingual support in our CMS because, of course, it&#8217;s still a little bit far out on our roadmap. We certainly have an opportunity to have the best implementation of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if like that specific use case that you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t related directly to what it is that you are working on for Polyglots and inside GlotPress and all of that, I do see that having more streamlined, more easy to see and access opportunities to like test the way that our software looks across varying environments, especially those that change it substantially from what we typically work in day-to-day for any individual developer or any individual WordPress site implementer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:00</strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I think that that is a big step forward for all of us and certainly for anyone who is having to use WordPress as not a native English speaker. And so you say it&#8217;s not related, but it still is a big, a big benefit for WordPress overall, I think, to have this kind of work happening so that we can have those benefits to the folks who are using our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were a couple of different things that you mentioned over the course of our conversation. We&#8217;re gonna put some links to the show notes for all of those. But one thing that you mentioned that just kind of went by, and we never really had an opportunity to talk about it. You talked about the, I think it was GTEs, Global Translation Editors, the folks that are like approved as final approvers of translations. If there is someone who&#8217;s listening to this podcast who wants to become a GTE someday, where would they go to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the path to GTE is a PTE.&nbsp;<em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got different levels of translation editors. Basically, you start, you could say you start off as a translator, and this is how you can kind of show that you can do good translations or that you&#8217;re very firm in your language. And this might make you be noticed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re always looking for people who like to help with translations. And you might be then promoted to be a Project Translation Editor. Basically, it means that for a single language in a project, you&#8217;ll be able to approve translations. So, you&#8217;ll be the one who says, like, this translation is a good one and this conforms to the to the rules that we have stated as a translation community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further down the path then is the GTE, where you basically are allowed to approve translations across any project on translate.WordPress.org in your language. And that&#8217;s, usually you&#8217;ll be in, in that position with other GTEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, like, in each community, there is like, we&#8217;re people based. We talk about what might be a good translation. We talk to each other, try to find rules that maybe prevent common mistranslations, or set the standards for how we want the software to be translated. And this is something where you get a voice as a translator, but as a GTE, you get into a position where you can actually make the changes or find consensus on how the software should be translated in your language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if folks are not familiar where the Polyglots team works and meets, where would they find you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:41]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At make.WordPress.org/polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Alex, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intermission music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things. First, WP Campus 2023 is taking place July 12th through the 14th. That&#8217;s a nonprofit three-day conference with topics that focus on the growth of higher education, accessibility, WordPress, and anyone who works in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hybrid event. There is an in-person component on the beautiful campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I&#8217;ll add information about that in our show notes for anyone who would like to join in person or online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that the mentorship program pilot that I have been talking about a little bit over the last few months has been formally launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in contributing more to the project but not sure where to begin, take a look at this comprehensive onboarding experience. It&#8217;s cohort-based. It has some personalized one-to-one mentorship. There are guided courses, live workshops, all of that.

And so stop by and add your thoughts there in the comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Her parents gave her own WordPress website to use, play, test, and try whatever she wanted with it. Her health issues had started when she was eight years old, and being able to express who she was and learn new skills provided an escape she needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first encounter with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison said: &#8220;While the technical aspects of my new WordPress website intrigued me, I was more interested in the space it made for me to write. All throughout my childhood I had struggled with chronic pain, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms. Having a private world I could call my own, I was able to write my story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;There is something truly amazing about having a place to tell your story.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family faced many doctors, nurse, specialists and hospital visits, but could not get an answer to the difficulties faced by Allison. She said: &#8220;I felt like my life and world were out of control. But logging onto my little website and typing away on the computer keys gave me a sense of control. I couldn’t always do things that other kids had the energy to do. But I could get lost in writing for hours. I couldn’t control my life story, but I could write about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt it was like writing letters to her future self and would act as a reminder of how strong she had become. Even now when Allison writes on her website, she feels it is writing letters to her past self, expressing reassurance and pride. The practice of writing online continues to help her reflect on how she coped and made it through the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in the real world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison hoped her early experiences with hospitals and being unwell was just part of being a child, and that in adulthood she would be healthy. She longed for this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up did not bring her this dream of a healthier life and an end to chronic pain. In fact, her condition worsened as she went through her teens and at 18 she finally received a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison stood in front of trees\" class=\"wp-image-15290\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Allison enjoying time with nature and trees</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This changed what had been conventional job choices, as she was not able to handle a 9 to 5 work schedule. She could not drive herself to work on some days and relied on her mother to help with transport. She knew that she would have to find another way to work and she was determined to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began writing music and book reviews online, and then moved onto writing blog posts. As they were published she started to receive payment and a sense of power over her life. She said: &#8220;WordPress felt familiar, typing on the computer keys felt comfortable, and sharing my words with the world felt surreal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison&#8217;s sense of ownership of the software became part of her strength. &#8220;I think I believed WordPress was mine somehow. I was learning that WordPress is something that belongs to everyone in some way. And I loved it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The confidence using the platform gave Allison led her to find more about what it could do and meet other people who used it. She said: &#8220;The thing I love about WordPress is that it’s not just for developers or bloggers or SEO experts. I began to meet more people in the community and was delighted to find people like me, who didn’t know the technical stuff, but were a part of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This global community orbiting around the software gave her an opportunity to meet social media managers, designers, and people from many different areas. She found that &#8216;there was a place for everyone&#8217;. The guiding strength and fascination Allison found and still finds today is in that community. Allison said: &#8220;The community felt as important as the rest of everything that makes WordPress what it is. It felt like it was about people and relationships as well as codes and databases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, she was hired by a WordPress company. She said: &#8220;I like being a part of a WordPress company, and I love that I contribute to a team that helps people with their websites. I understand the importance of having a space that’s yours. Whether it’s a business or personal site, having a website gives you the power of telling your own story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Allison a freedom and an independence. She did not have to work a 9 to 5 job, rely on others to drive her on bad days with her MS, nor worry about days when she wanted to stay in her sweatshirts rather than go into an office to work. She said: &#8220;I have a 100% remote job which I can do despite the plot twists in my story, thanks to WordPress and the people in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress took Allison into the world of project management for a small agency, and this experience was to help guide her path, skills and confidence into the future. She went on to work in content management in WordPress, building pages for awareness campaigns for non profit organizations and small businesses as a contractor. She helps people update their websites, add and edit content, perform basic updates and help them to learn how to use their sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I tell all my clients to use WordPress because there is really no other solution that can scale as easily for growing organizations and small businesses. I love how WordPress allows them to tell their stories, share their passion, and have a place to call their own on the internet.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fluent English and Italian speaker, Allison is able to support clients in different countries from where she lives. &#8220;I love that with WordPress I&#8217;m able to support clients remotely. This is thanks to all of the many WordPress contributors, developers, project managers, content writers, and many, many volunteers that work tirelessly to enable people around the world to use WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison also became a certified as an English As A Second Language (ESL) teacher. &#8220;My affinity for words and languages allows me to teach passionately and creatively. I’m Italian-American and am fluent in English and Italian. Teaching English allows me to share my passion for communication with others.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcomed into the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-15293\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison attributes mentors and supporters in the WordPress community for helping her appreciate she really is part of it. Allison recalled: &#8220;It felt unreal. I wasn’t a dev, I don’t know how to code, and yet I got to be a part of it all? I felt like I was a fake. But Kimberly continues to remind me that I’m real, I get to be here, I get to stay, I have a place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was later encouraged to contribute by a WordPress community member to the Big Orange Heart, which aims to support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities. She said she felt &#8216;honored typing my words, pieces of my story, and sharing them with a community of people&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also joined the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US 2021</a> online organizing team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison enjoys the fact that in the WordPress community, &#8216;everyone here is constantly working to be better and do better&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Facing the future with strength from her friends and colleagues in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=675%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15289\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was later diagnosed with two additional neurological conditions: Functional Neurological Disorder and Migraine. She said: &#8220;If it were not for WordPress I would really be unable to work. But WordPress and its community continue to be a part of my life and I am grateful to everyone who&#8217;s helped me along my way. I don&#8217;t know where I would even be without it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She strives to raise awareness of dynamic disabilities and invisible illnesses like her own through podcasts and social media.

00:00:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann. And here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have the privilege of guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing. And today I have with me a very special guest. The Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin. Welcome. Before we dive into all the questions, can you tell me and our listeners a little bit about your role in the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, happy to, and thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to be here. I am the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, and I provide oversight and guidance for our WordPress programs, such as our events programs, training, and Five for the Future, with an eye toward ensuring their sustainability and growth. I&#8217;m very fortunate to work with our contributors across many teams around the world. In addition to troubleshooting and helping folks figure out how to move forward, I also spend a good amount of time exploring with others what could be in our programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:01:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got back from WordCamp Europe in Athens, Greece. It was such an energizing event for me, but I&#8217;m curious about what your impressions were of the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:52]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was fantastic. I&#8217;m always really inspired by what a group of like-minded people can achieve together. There&#8217;s a lot of passion for this particular WordCamp, and it made for a really wonderful WordPress experience. Full of lots of great connections and memories; I have a million follow-ups and probably even more thoughts to reflect on. So it&#8217;s great. There were a lot of new WordPressers there. So it was lovely to meet them. And I&#8217;m really excited to see how many exciting new projects and ideas that we have in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:02:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same, you said it perfectly. Josepha also mentioned in the flagship’s keynote, the proposal for the next generation of WordCamps. I&#8217;m curious about what the main ideas and goals, as discussed thus far, are of that proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:02:42]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. So WordCamps have been fundamental for the WordPress community for a very long time. And while they have continued to grow larger and reach more places around the world, it&#8217;s also undeniable that the way that people meet has changed since 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, just as WordPress itself iterates we&#8217;re looking at iterating on WordCamps so that they move from fundamental to indispensable for the WordPressers of today and tomorrow. So event attendees today are looking to learn essential skills, make connections that lead to neat opportunities, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to that end, we put forth an updated purpose for our events, which is that WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal here is to create events that are more clearly defined &#8211; who these are for what you will gain from attending. We are looking to see events that take a deeper dive into content, or topics and provide more advanced content. And let&#8217;s try out some different formats and see how that shapes our event experience. And so it is a big shift. And change is always hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feedback that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, and certainly at WordCamp Europe, is that this is a very welcome evolution. And the Community team has already received over 60 proposals. So I&#8217;m very excited about that. In fact, a WordPress Community Day in Rome has already been announced and is focused on providing meet-up organizing and community management skills. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Chloé Bringmann 00:04:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s incredible. I love that we&#8217;ve gotten 60 suggestions already and that we already have an event in place. That&#8217;s fantastic. In that blog post, too, it&#8217;s mentioned that WordCamps should prioritize inclusivity and diversity. How can organizers ensure these values are upheld in the next generation of WordCamps and beyond events? Into our day-to-day project involvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:04]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent question. So while WordCamps themselves are changing, some of our core values, like prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, are non-negotiable. For the whole project, we have a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, and a Code of Conduct that lays out how we expect our community to engage with each other in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, our programs do focus on providing resources and training like how to create a diverse speaker roster. And we have diverse speaker training workshops on how to organize a diverse and inclusive WordPress event. And we also have a great list of third-party resources as well. And so, with so many events, we create a lot of opportunities to grow as a visible contributor, whether it is a speaker, a volunteer, or an organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:56]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with the next generation of events, we could more intentionally create these spaces for groups that historically have been underrepresented. Even long before my post went live, the BlackPress meetup group, for example, wanted to create an event that connected with historically black colleges and universities. And an event like that that really invites a specific group to learn all about WordPress would be a really great experience and a wonderful way to celebrate that community and a great connection to the broader community so that we can intentionally get to the diversity that we want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:06:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want to add that the people who are underrepresented in our community are more likely to need financial sponsorship. And so even though we do keep our ticket prices low so that our events are more easily accessible, the cost of travel continues to increase, not to mention the time and energy required to participate in these events. So an excellent way that companies can help is to sponsor somebody&#8217;s time and somebody&#8217;s contributions, which we&#8217;re always trying to encourage through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:07:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. So, with that in mind, how do you foresee the next generation of WordCamps impacting the WordPress community, that larger ecosystem? So, what changes do you hope to see regarding community engagement, learning opportunities, and best practices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I foresee us evolving our tried and true event format into a dynamic wealth of community-led opportunities. I know that online events were pretty exhausting during the worst of the pandemic, but there is a ton of unexplored opportunities there. And community research is also showing that online is a great way to create more inclusive and diverse events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training team, with their learn WordPress online workshops, have really led the way with our online events. And there are so many more people that we can reach there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:08]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in addition to providing more advanced content, I also hope to see content around broader tech and business trends that influence WordPress, and conversely, how WordPress can shape those trends as well. And with all of that, I really hope that we can bring in more community members that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what we currently offer, especially a younger generation that will help us drive the next generation of WordPress, the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:08:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to hear all of this, and I bet our listeners are too. I&#8217;m curious how they and community members can provide feedback or get involved with this next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone, please come chat with the Community team and comment on the current posts. We really welcome your feedback to help us get our events to this next iteration of what they will become. There are two posts, in particular, one is to suggest ideas of event formats and topics that you would like to see. And the second is if you are an organizer, we&#8217;re inviting you to hear some recommendations for improved tooling that would be helpful for your event site. And we&#8217;ll include links to those posts in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:09:26]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One final question for you, Angela. Any thoughts as we prepare for WordCamp US and the Community Summit, which will be in National Harbor, Maryland, in August?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Community Summit in particular, if you want to attend and you haven&#8217;t already applied, please please do make sure to apply as soon as possible. And encourage somebody else who you think should attend to apply as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if financial constraints are a blocker, we are aiming to help with the cost of hotel and or flight. And so one way to help support the diversity and inclusion of this event, and really to the whole project, is to also contribute to the Community Summit travel fund. You can find information about all of that on the Community Summit site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:10:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next, if you have a topic in mind that you think needs to be discussed at the Community Summit, please please also share that information with us as well. And last but not least, I am, I am so excited. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything. But I have been working with the WordCamp US organizing team and looking at some of what they have planned and some of the content. It&#8217;s going to be a truly incredible event, so don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:41]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me, Angela. And I can&#8217;t wait to see you and the WordPress community in August in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is the proposal and establishment of a new WordPress contributor team, the Sustainability team. Coming into WordCamp Europe, a proposal was put forward to create a team that would embed sustainable practices and processes in the ecosystem to ensure the Project&#8217;s longevity, both socially, economically, and as well environmentally. At WordCamp Europe, this proposal was confirmed, and the Sustainability team is now officially the 22nd contributor team that WordPressers can support with their contributions. Head on over to their making WordPress Slack channel, #sustainability, and join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:011:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I would like to call your attention to the 6.4 development cycle post that was published on June 5th. 6.4 will be the third major release of 2023 and supports our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by being led by those contributors that identify as underrepresented gender. This release will also be the first to kick off phase three of the Gutenberg roadmap, which is collaborative editing and workflows. I&#8217;ve included a link to the post in our show notes and encourage anyone who is interested in being part of this momentous release to join us in making this both impactful and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:012:16]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, WordCamp US, as discussed, will be upon us before we know it starting on August 24th at National Harbor, Maryland. While tickets may be sold out, volunteers are still very much needed to make the flagship event run smoothly.

More than 2,500 individuals from 94 countries came together in person or through the live stream to participate in a remarkable three-day event (plus Contributor Day) filled with talks, networking, and learning opportunities. The event concluded on June 10 with a captivating keynote address by WordPress co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, and Gutenberg Product Architect <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a>, who highlighted the advancements and upcoming milestones of the WordPress Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant update shared during the keynote was the successful reactivation of WordCamps. This time last year, we organized eight in-person WordCamps, and by the end of 2022, the number had risen to 23. Thanks to the enthusiasm and involvement of the WordPress community, we are already on track to organize 25 WordCamps in the first half of this year alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha also emphasized the importance of the upcoming Community Summit on August 22-23. This in-person gathering brings contributors together across the WordPress open source project, fostering cross-project discussions vital for future growth and sustainability.

She also underscored the expansion of the WordPress ecosystem, citing examples like <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, which now provides access to nearly 800 million images and audio files, all easily accessible in the Site Editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting addition to the WordPress repertoire is <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\">WP Playground</a>. This new feature allows users to build WordPress applications instantly in the browser without needing a PHP server. This tool provides a swift and seamless experience, reducing the installation time from five minutes to a near-instantaneous 500 milliseconds. The application of WP Playground may seem like magic, but its practical application promises tangible and revolutionary benefits for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías Ventura then took the stage to share updates on Gutenberg. Through a visually stunning video built entirely with blocks, he showcased the six-year development journey and the transition from words to blocks to a final design. The upcoming WordPress version 6.3 will mark the completion of the first two phases of Gutenberg, consolidating all these features into a cohesive and user-friendly experience. He also highlighted the introduction of features such as the Wayfinder tool, Style Book, and the ability to save patterns, further empowering users to own their web presence and voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote presentation, the WordPress leadership engaged in a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzKiKRodHQ0\"> lively Q&amp;A session </a>with the audience, further illustrating the continuous evolution within the WordPress Project. This session highlighted how the WordPress community innovates, iterates, and continually improves to create a better platform for today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzKiKRodHQ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global community and be part of the WordPress journey toward a brighter future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a> and <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>eidolonnight</a> for review and collaboration</em>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15167\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"The Month in WordPress – May 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 10:15:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:350:\"May has been a month of celebrating WordPress and the open source community that makes it possible.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this year, there has been a lot of research and examination of the contributor funnel in the WordPress community. That research confirms some assumptions about what most contributor stories have in common: the hurdles, the general paths taken, and the way that problem-solving was done. Then in February of this year, Hari Shanker published a proposal for a mentorship program for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we&#8217;ve got a pilot program that&#8217;s been defined and is waiting for your feedback. If you&#8217;ve not read the post about the contributor mentorship program, for one do it. But if you would rather hear a synopsis from me, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m about to give you a 10-cent tour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, who is doing this? This pilot program has been outlined by a community working group. We often have working groups in WordPress, and they almost always have specific projects around events or programs, or code updates. Since this working group is focused on a project-wide program, there is project-wide representation in it. All the names are at the bottom of the post, which you can find in our show notes. But it&#8217;s got folks who contribute with code or contribute with time or contribute with design folks who are self-sponsored or corporately sponsored, just a nice mix of people. The program as a whole, though, is being stewarded by Hari Shankar, a longtime supporter of and contributor to WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next, what is this for? There are a few goals for the program. But the overarching goal is to increase the success of new contributors over time. We can all agree that if we were to have 1000s of new contributors every day, but they couldn&#8217;t find their way to impactful contributions or meaningful connections quickly, then we would have done them a disservice. And they probably won&#8217;t continue to be part of the community without a bit more effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The when and the where are essentially “right now and right here,” so that brings us finally to Why. Why are we doing this mentorship program? Apart from to help people who want to contribute have an easier path to success – which frankly is enough of a reason anyway – the why is wrapped up in our overall philosophies in the project. If we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere and that contributions of any size matter. And that open source is an idea that can change our generation and that we are democratizing publishing, then bringing new people brings new ideas, and beginner contributions can grow over time. We can maintain this idea, this concept of open source, into the next generation and to future generations. And always keep our sights on the open web. To learn more about this and other project-wide initiatives, swing by make.wordpress.org/project or check the links in today&#8217;s show notes on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:56]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is WordCamp Europe. That&#8217;s coming up at the end of the week on June 8 through 10th in Athens, Greece. There will be a major update from Matt and friends, so even if you aren&#8217;t there in person, keep an eye out for those recordings. But for those who are there and you&#8217;re curious about the mentorship program or anything else to do with WordPress and contributing to the project, you can come find me or Angela Jin, Hari will also be there, Chloé will be there, Héctor will be there, lots of people, and we want to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is a call for brainpower! A call for your brainstorms! On the subject of the next generation, we&#8217;ve got a discussion going on about the next generation of WordCamps. We&#8217;ve been discussing what new types and varieties might be available, and that might make sense for people as we get back to in-person events. So if you&#8217;ve got a kind of WordCamp that you&#8217;ve been desperately wanting to try, now&#8217;s the time to let folks know about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is the second volume of The WordPress history book called Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress is now available for download in several formats as well as on GitHub.

admin is on deck for a long-awaited makeover after Gutenberg lead architect Matías Ventura published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">plans for a revamped admin design</a> as part of the Phase 3: Collaboration road map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As WordPress turns twenty years old, the overall aim of this work is to improve upon this experience at a foundational design level, giving plugins and users more control over the navigation while ensuring each WordPress experience is recognizable, intuitive, accessible, and delightful,&#8221; Ventura said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His post is a follow-up to some <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/06/13/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience/\">earlier admin concepts</a> he published a year ago which evolves the admin towards more fluid browsing and editing flows. This is similar to the block editor design that positions the admin frame as a shell that wraps around a canvas that contains the content in a zoomed state. Instead of users clicking back to access navigation tools, the tools remain present but outside of the canvas view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although contributors have not yet officially produced any designs for the project, Ventura shared a light version of an admin concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>One aspect of the proposed plans that has energized the developer community is the prospect of the admin getting rebuilt with an extensible design system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This effort is also an opportunity to formalize the design primitives and interaction paradigms that are part of the UI component system begun in <code>wordpress/components</code>,&#8221; Ventura said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A crucial aspect is to ensure WordPress itself is built with the same pieces and APIs that plugin authors can use. Aside from color themes, our set of primitive components also need to work in dense environments like the editor, as well as environments that need more breathing room and focus like admin sections. Density, clarity, usability, and accessibility are paramount.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: Matias Ventura &#8211; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">Admin Design</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The admin design concepts have renewed developers&#8217; excitement about the future of WordPress, but they are also hoping this revamp will solve several long-standing problems with the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One recurring theme in the feedback was the need to find a way to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/#comment-45084\">curb the pollution of top-level menus</a> and the out of control admin notices, which are hijacked by plugin developers in the absence of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-feature-notifications-project-progresses-towards-mvp-for-standardizing-admin-notifications\">a standard notification system</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s really about aligning APIs, ensuring we have semantic descriptions of capabilities, and offering the right levels of controls for both plugins and users,&#8221; Ventura said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I know it’s a fairly limited example, but there’s a nice balance in the ability to pin or unpin plugin sidebars on the editor, from the perspective that plugins can be opinionated, and users can still interact with those opinions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another challenge that concerns developers is ensuring the new design adequately accommodates WordPress sites with large numbers of posts, pages, categories, menus, comments, and other things that can easily overwhelm a UI that was intended to be simplified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As part of leveraging the components across the admin interface, we need to address functional gaps (like table and list views, bulk editing operations, etc) and assist plugin needs for anything that might not be already addressed that should be addressed,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Ultimately, the design library needs to be showcased in the wordpress.org website as a clear resource for people building upon WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers who participated in the comments were optimistic about the project and reacted positively to the concepts Ventura shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I often say, white space is where the magic happens,&#8221; WordPress designer and developer Brian Gardner said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The light admin concept is breathtaking and gets me even more excited than I am now about the future of WordPress.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several developers commented on how eagerly they are awaiting an update to a modern UI that reduces the number of page refreshes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wow! It’s gonna be amazing!&#8221; WPMarmite founder Alex Borto said. &#8220;A complete admin fluid browsing experience is much needed. I dream of navigating through the admin area without any page loads!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, WordPress developers have been expected to try to match WordPress&#8217; dated admin UI on their settings pages and the Yoast SEO plugin drew criticism when it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-20-0-introduces-new-admin-interface\">released version 20.0</a> with a new modern interface. Many users are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DerekAshauer/status/1617905808293113857\">not keen</a> on plugins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IdeaG/status/1617944840611987458\">building their own UI in the admin</a>, as it can make things more confusing. Having a standard set of UI components would make things easier for developers who are extending WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This gives me great optimism about securing the next 20 years of WordPress’s success,&#8221; WordPress developer Mike McAlister said. &#8220;The fact that you can do <em>anything</em> with WordPress is incredible, it’s probably our biggest strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But without standardized design patterns for the admin, we’ve seen that devolve into a UI/UX headache with plugin and theme developers baking their own experiences inside WordPress. Reining this in and creating a unified experience for everyone to buy into will not only make it easier on product creators, it will also be a huge win for users.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura said this document is just an outline of the admin design project and that it will be followed up with more in-depth design explorations further down the road.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 03:09:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.3 Beta 4 • Help Test • DEIB New Team Proposal • Gutenberg Phase 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149842\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-3-beta-4-help-test-deib-new-team-proposal/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22621:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (July 11, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">WordPress 6.3 is less than one month away.

They also talk about the need for businesses to treat their websites as valuable assets and allocate budgets for their maintenance and security. Websites have become an integral part of modern business operations, especially with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"video\" class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<li><strong>Website Security and Budgeting</strong>: Businesses must prioritize website security and allocate appropriate budgets for maintenance and protection. Websites are now integral to modern business operations, and their value should be recognized and treated as essential as physical security measures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Effective Client Communication</strong>: Clear and proactive communication with clients is crucial. Agencies should manage client expectations, set boundaries, and communicate any limitations, such as response times during vacations or other periods of unavailability. Managing client communication helps build trust and ensures a smoother working relationship.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Community Engagement and Personal Well-being</strong>: Engaging with the WordPress community and participating in events like WordCamps can be valuable for networking, knowledge sharing, and staying updated with industry trends.

Hey, everybody. Welcome back to Post Edits Draft. We&#8217;ve got another interview in our series on agency journeys. And I&#8217;m talking to a long time friend of mine, Rob Carnes, who has been very active in post. It&#8217;s been to a bunch of our meetups and I&#8217;m really excited to share his story today. So Rob, thanks for being on The Post podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:00:21) &#8211; My pleasure, Corey. Glad to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:00:24) &#8211; Well, Rob, let&#8217;s dive in. Tell us a little bit about yourself and your agency today. Name and what you do. What kind of work primarily you do for your clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:00:34) &#8211; Okay, So my name is Rob Cairns. I&#8217;m in the greater Toronto area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I should tell you, before I got into running an agency, I have a very tech heavy background which a lot of agency owners don&#8217;t have. So I come out of an enterprise healthcare environment, doing servers, doing all kinds of cool stuff to support one of Toronto&#8217;s biggest hospitals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:00:58) &#8211; Before that I was actually an old time COBOL programmer. There&#8217;s probably a word that you haven&#8217;t heard in a long, long time, and I spent some time in the financial industry, so I&#8217;ve got a bit of a business background. And then I jumped into agency life because, you know, I always tell the story. I never planned to be in marketing because I had a marketing professor in school back in the 80s who came in the class, and her whole thing was, Oh, I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m here because I want my summers off. And I said, I swore then in there I&#8217;d never be a marketer if you paid me money to. Well, I lied. So, yeah. And I run I run an agency that&#8217;s WordPress focused. A lot of it is WordPress security stuff right now and some builds and then a lot of email marketing and consulting these days. That&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:01:50) &#8211; Yeah. And what&#8217;s your agency name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:01:53) &#8211; Stunning digital marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:01:55) &#8211; And what&#8217;s the website for your.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:01:58) &#8211; Digital marketing is the agency site and digital marketing.info is like my Linktree site. It&#8217;s got links to everything I do on the web and where you can find me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:02:09) &#8211; Excellent. Excellent. Well, I know as I&#8217;ve gotten to know you through some of the meetups, too, I hear more and more about the work you do, and it always impresses me. You&#8217;re like, Hey, is anybody worried about this particular update? And and I know you managed quite a few sites and it always I always like lean in when you talk about that because it&#8217;s at the heart of what a lot of agency work, particularly at post is that our agencies do is that beast of maintaining WordPress across multiple WordPress client sites. Well, great. Thank you for that. So tell me a little bit about how you got there. I heard a little preface of that, but I wanted to start out with where you are today. Um, and then talk about how you got there. That&#8217;s always the compelling part of these Journey series to me is what happened before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:02:59) &#8211; So this is today and then what? What&#8217;s a little snippet of how what led up to where you are today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:03:06) &#8211; So where I am today was kind of how I got there was us working in healthcare. I wasn&#8217;t happy, I&#8217;ll tell you that now. I was working probably 60 to 70 hours a week at the time. So this is going back 14 years ago was when we started and I was extremely unhappy and somebody said to me, So why don&#8217;t you just go? And I said, Well, I&#8217;ve been here 21 years, so if they want to get rid of me, it&#8217;s going to cost some lots of money to get rid of me. So let&#8217;s force the hand and see where it goes. Well, 14 years ago, my dad was sick with pancreatic cancer at the time he actually passed away July 8th, the anniversary that&#8217;s coming up. And they decided, knowing I was going to be taking some time off, they decided we need to we&#8217;re going to make some changes and you can go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:03:56) &#8211; And at that point, I was already building WordPress websites on the side. So I just kind of transitioned to what I was doing on the side full time. Now here&#8217;s where it got interesting. I decided really quickly only building the website, it&#8217;s only part of getting it out there. You still got a market that site and you got to do it properly. So I made a decision then and there. I was going to build a full stack marketing agency. I&#8217;ve taken some courses, a lot of courses. One of my mentors in this space is a gentleman by the name of Paul Tobey, who I&#8217;m founder of. Paul. Toby&#8217;s actually the father of Adrian Toby, the founder of Groundhog, who you know. So that&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:04:40) &#8211; Love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:04:40) &#8211; Adrian Yeah, love Adrian, Love. His dad saw his dad in January, actually, and we sat in his house and listened to him play some jazz tunes for us where we were visiting and and then transitioned in and at one time was offering all kinds of services and then just realized some of these are just don&#8217;t want to do so I just kind of niche down and got out of what I didn&#8217;t want to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:10) &#8211; Got you. So how long ago did you go? Full time with the business?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:05:16) &#8211; 14 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:18) &#8211; 14 years ago. Okay. That&#8217;s awesome. We were going strong about the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:05:22) &#8211; Yeah, about same time. And you. And you and I connected, I think the first time about 14 years ago when I was in the headway community. And you were running the items community. And you&#8217;d be proud to know two of the products in my security stack back up by the in 19 security are still there to this day so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:40) &#8211; Oh that&#8217;s fantastic to hear. Well, okay, So I&#8217;m really curious. Was there a point when you were like, doing this on the side? What was that juncture when you&#8217;re like, okay, I&#8217;m going to do this full time? A lot of the stories we hear, I hear in It&#8217;s My Own is some event. Something helped kind of catalyze the process to become a full time entrepreneur. And so I&#8217;m curious. So not happy, of course. And then, hey, I think you might have mentioned this just a second ago, but I want to make sure I&#8217;m clear on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:06:13) &#8211; So was there event that kind of like, okay, I&#8217;m doing this full time, this is the only thing I&#8217;m doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:06:18) &#8211; So my as I say, my dad was battling pancreatic cancer at the time. Oh, right. Yeah. I went on three weeks vacation after I was on the corporate project, number one, and amassing overtime like nothing. And I walked back in on a Monday morning. I got a call from the director&#8217;s secretary at 10 a.m. and say, Director won&#8217;t see you in a boardroom at 3:00. And the boardroom was not the normal boardroom for meetings. So I just kind of put my feet up and said, okay, I know how this day&#8217;s going to play out. Welcome back from vacation for me. And believe it or not, I actually shipped everything personal home from work at lunchtime in a cab because I saw the writing on the wall. I&#8217;d seen it on the wall for a while. Yeah. Then I get, um, I get called in and the director says, Do you know why you&#8217;re here? I said, So you&#8217;re going to let me go, so let&#8217;s just get it over with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:07:16) &#8211; And the h.r. Manager turned to me and said, how do you how do you feel about all this? And my response at the time was, my lawyer will tell you at 9:00 tomorrow morning. Now you&#8217;re like no other comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:07:27) &#8211; Now at this time, you were already doing things on the side, though, right? Yeah, I think that&#8217;s important to note in the story because, you know, some of these events that happen, but you were already kind of testing the waters, building some kind of side hustle side gig on the side. So you didn&#8217;t just, you know, jump out into the ether. You had something kind of built up. Were you doing work for like client? I mean, friends? How did the the side gig kind of start parallel to that side gig?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:07:59) &#8211; Actually, it&#8217;s really interesting you ask that question. Being in tech, I&#8217;m like a resource in my family and you can appreciate that. So I did go to the let&#8217;s send an email to let&#8217;s ask the question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:08:13) &#8211; And I actually got fed up with family, believe it or not, and I wrote a website at that time was HTML and said, by the way, here&#8217;s all the family pictures from the event last week because I was also the manager of all that digital stuff. And by the way, here&#8217;s links to all the questions you guys asked me and nobody&#8217;s allowed to ask me a question until you go to these links and and actually do your own homework. So that was my start into domains and all of that and web stuff. And the other thing that started it was this is going back to the days of dial and dialing Internet providers, if we remember those days. Yep. And trauma, they were a dime a dozen. So I used to switch providers, i.e. email services more than most people because I get fed up with one dial in provider and I cancel. I go to another one, I cancel, I go to another one, I cancel. So I finally said, Forget this, I&#8217;m going to register a domain which I still have to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:09:15) &#8211; And then that was kind of my foray in. And then after doing static sites, I realized WordPress was the way to go and that&#8217;s what kind of opened the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:09:24) &#8211; So what was your introduction to WordPress? What kind of time period did you start using?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:09:28) &#8211; WordPress would have been about 16, 15 years ago. 16 years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:09:32) &#8211; Yeah, right. Right. In its first early heyday for sure. That&#8217;s about the same time I got started with WordPress, this cool platform that you didn&#8217;t have to manage with all these HTML top software and updated 100 pages you could do with one click. Essentially this concept of content management system was really, really crazy and awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:09:53) &#8211; We all remember the famous five minute WordPress install where our our hosting providers didn&#8217;t have a one click installer like stop flashes or any of them. We had to do it ourselves, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:10:05) &#8211; And yeah, we did it. I mean, I&#8217;m trying to remember when I did that, if it was FTP, you know, putting it on the server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:10:14) &#8211; Yeah, I&#8217;m trying to think back about that. I use soft tactless quite a bit in the early days, but that was magical back then. If you think about it, it&#8217;s like I want the ability to do build a website and I don&#8217;t have to learn too many technical logistics. I remember googling. What does FTP mean? That was one of our first post that I themes because I was like, if I have this question, I bet you a bunch of other people have this question. But yeah, WordPress made it easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:10:40) &#8211; Yeah. I have to tell you a funny story. You appreciate being over it. I think so. I had a client years ago. It was Australian, one of my first big clients, and he didn&#8217;t see the spending the money on something like backup buddy. So the silly client came back to me and said, So write me the documentation process of tobacco and restore a website menu and document it out. And the story goes that the cost to him paying for that documentation at the time would have cost him more than a yearly license for backup money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:11:12) &#8211; Well, even or not. So needless to say, he became a backup buddy. Pretty convert pretty quickly. Corey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:11:20) &#8211; So. Well, okay, so you go full time with the agency starting to do on work. I know somewhere in there was like, Hey, there&#8217;s more to just the actual website build. There&#8217;s marketing different parts around the website. Um, as you look back, you know, 15 years now, what were some of the catalytic events that help you in your agency, personal professional, WordPress, all these things. If you look back where like 3 or 4 of the things that really made the difference in your agency to where you&#8217;re now, I know you&#8217;ve been doing this a long time. I know you&#8217;ve been able to have freedom of life to do different things in your life as part of the business part of WordPress, which is always the magic, I think, WordPress. But if you look back, what are those couple of things that kind of stand out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:12:06) &#8211; Um, a couple of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:12:07) &#8211; One is I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so my mother is 78 years old, still alive and still selling houses, believe it or not. As a real estate agent, my aunt who passed away at 92, was one of the top real estate brokers for Century 21 in the Farmington, Detroit area for many, many years. First successful. I come from a family who&#8217;s done business on their own, so that helps. My father was a CFO for an insurance broker, so that helps. That helped install some money sense into me and some business sense into me. I&#8217;m also a lifelong learner. So you and I have talked over the years about how much reading I do or how much listening to other podcasts. I do believe it or not, my own podcast is not on my podcast player backdrop. I&#8217;m busy listening to everybody else&#8217;s because think you got to get a variety of point. And then kind of just people along the way. People like yourself. People like Paul. Toby Paul was a big catalyst for giving me credit and saying, you know, more than like 75% of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:13:21) &#8211; Just go after it. So Paul was really good for me around mindset more than just technical stuff, so that was good. And then things like in my life recognizing and you and I have had this conversation about mental health challenges and the whole pearls around that. You&#8217;ve been through it. I&#8217;ve been through it. We&#8217;ve talked about it very candidly together over the years. That has helped. Am probably. 200% more mental health. Healthy today in my 50s and was in my 30s. I would say that, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:13:58) &#8211; I think I want to say ditto. I think I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:14:02) &#8211; And then surrounding yourself with the right people and people like yourself, people like post others group people like, you know, people outside of the post group, people you can go to and say, Hey, I just need an ear or, Hey, I&#8217;m stuck on something technical. I should know doing that. And then kind of. A big part of all this was deciding a number of years ago that I&#8217;m such a security junkie and I always was, even when I was in health care, and I need to dive into the security space and put my time and money there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:14:38) &#8211; And that was a big part of it, too. And that&#8217;s how that came to birth. You mentioned, I imagine, websites as of yesterday&#8217;s count 418, believe it or not, just from an update in security perspective and growing by the day. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:14:53) &#8211; It&#8217;s it&#8217;s for sure become a thing in a good part of our industry and community that there&#8217;s agencies like yours and I&#8217;ve talked to a lot that that are recognized WordPress is awesome. There&#8217;s a lot of things that go into it as far as keeping those things updated. So somebody goes, Oh, I built it, you know, I built the baseball field, Field of Dreams. It&#8217;s there. Cool. Everybody&#8217;s going to come to it. There&#8217;s two sides of the coin that&#8217;s really interesting with your story. One is that updates security. Part of it got to keep the field maintained. The other side is the marketing part. I found this fascinating because you&#8217;ve got this to blend of marketing and the really the maintenance said that includes this big topic called security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:15:37) &#8211; Yep, it&#8217;s true. And like one of the biggest things I think agency owners don&#8217;t do well is they don&#8217;t manage their own mailing lists, let alone their client mailing lists. And email marketing has become one of my strengths over the years and think that is a big deal because the only thing you really own is your website. In your mailing list. Everything is kind of what we call rented land or other people&#8217;s land in the rules change by the day and it gets to be awful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:16:07) &#8211; So yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of people. I think a lot of the WordPress community saw one thing from my work at things, but I go, you know, one want to know the key to what we built. There&#8217;s a lot of keys, right? But one of the big keys, especially marketing, was email marketing. And I love how you said website, what you really own, the website and email address. You don&#8217;t even own the rankings. You got to keep working on those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:16:32) &#8211; You got to you don&#8217;t even necessarily on the traffic. You got to keep working on those things. But when you have the what click for me with email marketing, was this old school, now old school concept of direct marketing when people used to go door to door and still do of course, to sell something to that person directly. And I think that was when it clicked for me is email is direct marketing where I don&#8217;t control the algorithms and whatever tech billionaire is going to buy another of the social media platforms. But if I consistently build I was actually talking to entrepreneur last week about this, just she&#8217;s just getting started with the physical product. And I said, Hey, you know, all the jazz and the sexiness is out on the social media platforms. However, it&#8217;s a great way to get started, push them, funnel them into an email where you can still to date in 2023, directly market. It still works, but so many are adverse to it or don&#8217;t do the work to keep up their keep up, grow, maintain their email lists and use them properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:17:37) &#8211; And to segment them properly. Mean the big issue is. So I&#8217;ll give you an example. I have an email list that&#8217;s running about 7500 active right now. I&#8217;ve probably got, if you count people have an open stuff in like the last 60 days and probably closer to 1200. So the key is not to send emails to your host, send them to the 7500 that are active and then every six months touch base with the other people once in a while, like because honestly, that&#8217;s waste of time and money. Like don&#8217;t put your emphasis there, but you segment your list and figure out what people want from you and who&#8217;s going to open stuff. And as a result, on that 7500, I run an open rate of about listeners about 62% on a regular basis. Which is incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:18:29) &#8211; Yeah, indeed. And it all takes work. Websites, take work, emails take a work to properly do it well. So. So you know, a couple of the things I&#8217;m interested in. The last 15 years or so you&#8217;ve been doing, this is what you&#8217;ve seen kind of transition the evolution of WordPress you know, from and websites within that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:18:53) &#8211; So you know how WordPress has gone in the last 15 years. Where do you think it is now? Where do you think it&#8217;s going in the future, what your clients are seeing and value in as part of having a great web presence? And I&#8217;m curious your thoughts on those two things. So the underlying technology has grown 15 years. We just celebrated 20th anniversary of WordPress, which is just fascinating to me. Um, and then, you know, this, this changing perception, I think growing, valuing perception of websites, the value of having a WordPress type website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:19:29) &#8211; So there&#8217;s a couple of things. When we all started with WordPress, you and I, it was basically a blogging platform and now we&#8217;re building these whole robust membership sites, e-commerce sites, we&#8217;re building all this stuff and it&#8217;s incredible. And people say, Oh, why don&#8217;t you go to an e-commerce platform? Well, I have to tell you, I picked up the paper today, this morning before we jumped on this call. Corey and Shopify, who we all know is one of the big e-commerce products, is in trouble with the Canadian government because they refuse to hand over shopping records to the tax people so they can go after individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:20:10) &#8211; And the cool thing about WordPress is that&#8217;s all self contained. So as we get into this privacy era, everything&#8217;s within your dashboard and you can even buy marketing solutions like Groundhog Adrian, Toby or Fluent CRM, another one that resides right inside that dashboard which protects your privacy and puts you in control. And I think that&#8217;s the whole thing about WordPress. The other big thing I&#8217;ve seen is a big change in the hosting space. And you&#8217;ll agree with me, um, what&#8217;s old is good and what hosting companies have reinvented themselves in the last while. And two I like to point out to is one over at New fold and we both of us have a mutual friend there in the name of Dave Ryan at Neufeld. So Dave and his team, I&#8217;ve had many dealings with them. They were the old endurance and they came out of that. And they&#8217;re trying to reinvent themselves by running around and buying plug ins like they bought Yoast and they bought it and doing things like that. And then important for new fold, they&#8217;ve become more community aware than they&#8217;ve ever become before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:21:19) &#8211; So this was not the idea of eight years ago or nine years ago. I can guarantee that. And they&#8217;ve changed. And then you take somebody like her friends up at GoDaddy and, you know, I know that team pretty well for work I&#8217;ve done, and they&#8217;ve reinvented themselves. They&#8217;ve come out of the ashes of the Danica Patrick ads, as we call them. Remember those? Could you see a sexist ad like that flying in today&#8217;s society? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:21:50) &#8211; No. We&#8217;ve evolved past that for sure for for better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:21:55) &#8211; But they&#8217;ve also reinvented themselves. And then even in a hosting space, you got companies like Liquid Web and WP Engine and Cloud, and then you&#8217;ve got companies that were leaders that have kind of dropped off. And a company I throw into a group like that is Siteground think, you know. Ten years. Five years ago, they were great. And then somethings kind of happened. So things go cyclical. Um, in terms of the technology more, it&#8217;s worth mentioning where we&#8217;ve gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:22:25) &#8211; So we&#8217;ve gone from coding and WordPress with plugins to page builders and your team and I think this is one of the first with, with your builder product, right? And themes to, to build sites. And then we got into things like headway, which we all know the story of what happened there and they were part of their problems. They were miles ahead of their time and just not adapted. And then we got into the traditional page builders like the Beaver Builders, the Yeah, Elementor, the bricks, that kind of stuff, which is prominent now. And now we&#8217;re headed to this magical thing called blocks. And you know, there&#8217;s a couple block ecosystems. The one I use is cadence. I&#8217;ve been all in with Cadence for a couple of years now. So there&#8217;s evolution, that spot. And I think we&#8217;re we&#8217;re starting to see more is WordPress is becoming more than just a publishing platform. Automattic owns Tumblr, Automattic owns pocket casts, one of the biggest pocket podcast players out there. They own the day One journal, which is a journaling app, um, would encourage anybody out there who needs a journaling product to go get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:23:45) &#8211; It&#8217;s worth every penny of it, like honestly. So they&#8217;re trying to democratize that whole, the whole solution. So, so a lot that&#8217;s gone on in 20. Um.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:23:59) &#8211; Yeah, there&#8217;s a whole history there and everything you talked about. I think what stands out was the hosting industry. It&#8217;s definitely evolved, grown and a lot of money has come into WordPress hosting space in particular. You talk about new Fold in Endurance, for instance, like it&#8217;s turned over, been sold and bought so many acquisitions in the space and for good reason, because WordPress is a great platform for millions of people to build their website on. So but you know, there&#8217;s a trend there too, which is you talked about the reinvention and kind of coming out of stuff. What I&#8217;ve seen in 15 years plus years or so is. Yeah, it starts out good. Trying to claim her to get new customers. New clients, show them, you know, help them with their stuff. And it seems a lot of cyclical ness of like, okay, they reached this point where now they&#8217;re trying to really all the hosting companies, I would say, should make a profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:25:02) &#8211; But then there&#8217;s a swath that like, okay, increasingly trying to make it more profitable to understand part of business. However, then you see customer service and support start to kind of fade with some of that and then you get this whole, okay, they&#8217;re going down and then going up. And I&#8217;ve I&#8217;m not going to name the names, but there&#8217;s a lot there where you see the cyclical up and down of that hosting side, which isn&#8217;t always healthy for WordPress either. I get it as a business part. What they need to do for their shareholders, partners, all that kind of stuff. But it&#8217;s definitely changed from like 2008 when I think this was on a shared hosting plan for like, I don&#8217;t know, $5 a month or $10 a month at like HostGator. And it&#8217;s I&#8217;ve kind of bemoaned it some because what the effect now is the experience for the WordPress user, those people that are your clients that are using their website and there&#8217;s that up and down. They&#8217;ve had to ride some of that and it&#8217;s always not good thing for the health of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:26:06) &#8211; It&#8217;s true. And the other thing I should add to to this discussion is I think the team up at Automattic, the parent company of WordPress, has been much more receptive to comments, suggestions than ever before. And I know some people don&#8217;t feel that way, but I think we&#8217;re in really good hands with Josepha being the executive director of the WordPress project, you know, and things like that. And I know on the Gutenberg side I&#8217;ve gotten to know Matthias Venture, The Gutenberg lead a little bit and, and people like our friends Polly Hack or people like Jessica Frick over at Percival, which is an automatic company. People like that have put us in pretty good hands, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:26:52) &#8211; Yeah, my personal opinion is automatic has long term commitment to the industry and I&#8217;m really proud to have them as sponsors a lot of automatic and post status and for good reason. But you know a long term commitment to like they have had the opportunity for many years to really really monetize what WordPress is and have held back. I think this is only my personal opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:27:18) &#8211; No facts really share other&#8217;s leadership there. But get go have had a long term commitment because they believe in open source, they believe in the open web and the ecosystem is healthy. When you have a diverse set of people offering services and products to that, so you get great performance. Obviously they know WordPress inside and out and then the support and those are the things that have that kind of wane over time. In any hosting company that I&#8217;ve been, that I&#8217;ve been around, I&#8217;ve had I&#8217;ve been a customer at many of the ones you talked about had clients and friends at many of the ones that you talked about. And but the consistency, I think, is what matters overall. So I agree with you. Agree. Um, okay. So we&#8217;ve talked about a whole lot of stuff. Now I want to talk I want to ask this specific question related to your clients. What are you hearing from your clients about WordPress, how they&#8217;re using their websites? Because I love talking to our agency owners because tip of the spear for me is the people out there doing the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:28:20) &#8211; For those people using WordPress, they might not even know or care that there&#8217;s this open source platform underneath it all. But what are you hearing from your clients about what WordPress and working with the websites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:28:32) &#8211; Yeah, there&#8217;s a couple things. I don&#8217;t think my clients care what&#8217;s under the hood. So by that mean they don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s a WordPress site, if it&#8217;s a custom site, if it&#8217;s something else, as long as it gives them the results they want. So one of the things I&#8217;ve been pushing in the community for the last ten years is don&#8217;t sell the solution. Sell what it brings you. I&#8217;m a big one. Outcome or something, not how you get there. And if anybody doesn&#8217;t believe that, I suggest you go look up a guy by the name of Simon Sinek. Start with why is his book and find his Ted talk and watch it and watch it again. So sell the the what you get out of it. So that&#8217;s the first one. I also think clients hate to say are dropping the security ball big time right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:29:21) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a site right now where the client couldn&#8217;t find their backup that they were sending to a cloud drive for six days and they took them six days to find out where they put that backup. So one of the things I find with my clients is you have to help them manage their digital assets or their digital stuff, and even more so in small businesses. What happens if the business owner gets run over by a truck tomorrow? What happens if he dies tomorrow? Do you have a succession plan for your business? Do you know how to handle that? Most people don&#8217;t. So that&#8217;s a problem. And then the other thing is, I think a lot of people flock to WordPress because frankly, what are we powering now? 45% in the Internet, 50% somewhere in there. And I think that alone is a selling thing. That&#8217;s attraction. Thing is WordPress is open source. It can&#8217;t be secure the security holes every month. Well, guess what? Microsoft Windows plugs security holes on the first Tuesday every month called Patch Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:30:27) &#8211; And the whole business world runs on Windows more than that. Right. And they&#8217;re still plugging holes. Security is a trust factor, not a it happened or it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:30:37) &#8211; So I like that because security is a non-essential part of the digital our digital world, particularly our Internet, it&#8217;s a part of it. The real question is how are the people or companies behind that making sure it&#8217;s always secure. I remember talking to a security expert. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s been eight years now and they said it&#8217;s not a matter this is one that just all they do is security and they go, it&#8217;s not a matter of if we&#8217;ll get hacked, it&#8217;s when and what we&#8217;re doing continually. And I go, that&#8217;s part of the digital age. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at. So I love that emphasis from your point. It&#8217;s just not when it&#8217;s if. And what are you doing in the meantime to help proactively do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:31:19) &#8211; And I&#8217;ll take that one more. Corey I have a saying in my business that&#8217;s not if you&#8217;ll be hacked, it&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll be hacked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:31:25) &#8211; And how do you recover where I take it? So I kind of look at this mess I&#8217;ve been dealing with, and a big part of the problem was the client didn&#8217;t have a site updated, the client didn&#8217;t have the PHP version updated, the client couldn&#8217;t find the backup. You see where this is going? Yep. And it&#8217;s we got to take care of those assets and we got to treat them like the they&#8217;re important. So that&#8217;s that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:31:52) &#8211; Just like you would lock your car or your house at night or your car if you&#8217;re driving into the supermarket or the grocery store, whatever that is, you&#8217;d lock your car because, you know, you do those things. We don&#8217;t even think about those things. They&#8217;re so embedded now and we need to be doing that. I love this message. We need to be doing that with our digital assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:32:11) &#8211; We&#8217;re a mutual friend of ours. You know, Kathy&#8217;s N over at K very well. And I turned to Cathy in January and said, I&#8217;m going to make you a prediction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:32:20) &#8211; And she said, Oh, I don&#8217;t like your predictions are usually right. And I said, I&#8217;m going to declare 2023 as a year of the vulnerability, the first week of January. And that was coming out of the whole LastPass debacle that happened. And we all know about that one. And sure enough, and I think it&#8217;s partially awareness, but I think there&#8217;s a multitude of factors and it&#8217;s kind of played out that way. The other thing I&#8217;m hearing from clients is clients don&#8217;t realize that websites have to have a budget attached to them for their business. So marketing budget and they say, Oh, we do it in house. And I say, okay, so what&#8217;s your hourly rate worth? Oh, it&#8217;s worth $40 an hour. How many hours a month do you do? Oh five. So your marketing budget is 40 times five. So that&#8217;s the other thing. Business has got to take this stuff seriously and start to budget for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:33:17) &#8211; I love that Social Security and then budget, and that&#8217;s the mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:33:21) &#8211; So, you know, a lot of the conversations I&#8217;ve been having is the recognition from clients that their website is not just valuable, it&#8217;s an integral part of how they do business. Covid accelerated a lot of that. I think it&#8217;s like, Hey, we got so many physical location, bricks and mortar type businesses realizing when you can&#8217;t actually see a person face to face. So I have two way of a way to be able to do business. So I love that it&#8217;s integral. So security, part of life budgeting, you need to budget for it just like you would any other part of your businesses in the essential part of your business. And so many of the agency owners have talked to here at Post Status, they the clients are recognizing that it&#8217;s in some of the instances, I would say more like a B2B. They see it&#8217;s at a very, very valuable part of their overall sales strategy and they value it deeply. Some run their whole operations or half operations, you know, and items and post those two, we run our whole operation through online space so it feels foreign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:34:26) &#8211; But that&#8217;s not the way business is traditionally. It&#8217;s, you know, you go to a store, you travel, you walk, you ride in a horse and buggy or a car to get to. Things have changed. And that seems like what I&#8217;m hearing, too, is that mindset needs a change of like this is all a part of business domains, websites, all the platforms you might be on, all as important as that door that opens up into your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:34:51) &#8211; 100% and then look at the criticality of it. So, for example, if you&#8217;re an e-commerce site that&#8217;s making 30,000 US a day profit, then you need a different level of support than somebody that&#8217;s got a brochure site that is out there just to be the face of their business. So you got to think about things like that, too. Very much so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:35:12) &#8211; Okay, so security and budget. Anything else on your mind about when you when you&#8217;re working with clients and how they&#8217;re valuing their websites? Any perspectives you have to share there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:35:22) &#8211; I think a lot of clients in this day and age are unrealistic and think that&#8217;s the world we live in. So it&#8217;s a very much an I want it now world. It&#8217;s I want it yesterday. There&#8217;s no patience out there like to tell you I don&#8217;t think clients are any different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:35:39) &#8211; So. Yeah. So it&#8217;s the physical part of business, which I have a friend that has a restaurant supply business and I understand how like when you&#8217;re, you know, stove or cooktop is down, they can&#8217;t sell. And then now that okay, got to have it now. And that service side is pretty intense for them. I can see that now being applied to the business is where they see it as essential. I want to say that&#8217;s a good part, but when it comes with some mindset change of okay, we need to be able to budget for that and pay for that and, and knowing like in the middle of the night or whatever it is to have that kind of service turnaround is not always possible or realistic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:36:27) &#8211; And communication is a big part of it too. I don&#8217;t think some clients communicate well, don&#8217;t think some agencies communicate well. Like, for example, I&#8217;m going on vacation next Wednesday. Yay me, I&#8217;ve already sent out an email to my entire client was saying, By the way, the only thing I&#8217;ll deal with while I&#8217;m away is a website down issue. Everything else sits till I get home and just tell them upfront. Now, they might not like to hear it, but that&#8217;s you&#8217;re allowed to take time off. You&#8217;re allowed to recharge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:36:58) &#8211; The good communication, getting ahead of it to manage those expectations? Yeah, absolutely vital. All right, Rob. Well, anything else you want to share that you&#8217;re excited about, that you&#8217;re working on or doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:37:10) &#8211; I think the big thing is the security side of it. Think, think. We just got to be aware and and make sure you&#8217;re aware and if and if anybody needs help agencies otherwise reach out, be glad to help them and be involved in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Cairns (00:37:25) &#8211; That&#8217;s a big part of what you and I do. You do not repost status. As you know, I co-manage a large LinkedIn group with Courtney Robertson. I&#8217;ve got a podcast that&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s good for business awareness, but it&#8217;s also good for the community too. So get involved. The community. Somebody if you can go to a word camp, go says the guy who&#8217;s got no time to go to work. Camps right now have not been to a five check by I missed word camp Buffalo Oh boy did I take stuff for not being on that one because that was a that&#8217;s an hour and a half away. I didn&#8217;t go to Montclair this weekend because, again, I&#8217;ve got conflicts. And the other thing is, look after you and your family and look after how you feel. Look after your health. Because if you don&#8217;t do that, you can&#8217;t run your business. So keep that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:14) &#8211; Absolutely. Well, thanks, Rob, for being on post staff.

Or maybe a member of the press wants to set up an interview. Perhaps qualified job candidates want to get in touch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the reason, it’s usually a good idea to have a means of contact through your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, you can add a contact form in WordPress to make it a quick and easy process for visitors to reach out. And you can even include special fields to help identify the purpose of each inquiry and respond quickly and effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll discuss nine simple steps to add a contact form in WordPress. And we’ll tell you about the best ways to prevent fake spam submissions from clogging your inbox. Then, we’ll address the most frequently asked questions concerning contact forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-95555\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Choose a contact form plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to add a contact form to your website is to use a WordPress plugin that simplifies the process. You can find tons of free (and paid) options that offer a similar type of service. But, most premium plugins come not only with a simple contact form template, but additional options and advanced features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\">Contact Form 7</a> is a popular choice. While it comes with a steep learning curve for beginners, the tool is free and can be installed on an unlimited number of sites. In addition, it&#8217;s important to note that this plugin doesn’t store or save contact form submissions unless you add a second tool called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/\">Flamingo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image7-1.png\" alt=\"Contact Form7 plugin page\" class=\"wp-image-96498\" width=\"1000\" height=\"364\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You can also accept file uploads, display a confirmation message upon submission, and extend the plugin with several add-ons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you’re looking for a straightforward WordPress contact form plugin that’s quick to learn, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a>’s an excellent choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image6-1.png\" alt=\"Jetpack homepage\" class=\"wp-image-96499\" width=\"1000\" height=\"426\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a super beginner-friendly tool, since it enables you to add the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-blocks/contact-form/\">Form block</a> to your page in the same way that you’d use any other WordPress block. Even better, you get tons of configuration options.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, you’re able to change the confirmation message and redirect users after submission. Additionally, you can continue to edit and reorder the layout of your form even after you’ve added fields to your page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Jetpack also has a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/best-wordpress-comment-plugins-compared/\">WordPress comment feature</a> and integrates seamlessly with anti-spam tools like <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>, enabling you to protect your site from any illegitimate or malicious form submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Install and activate the plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Jetpack is a free plugin, you can install and activate it right within the WordPress dashboard. Simply head to <strong>Plugins → Add New. </strong>Then, search for “Jetpack”.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image16.png\" alt=\"Jetpack plugins in the WordPress repository\" class=\"wp-image-96500\" width=\"1000\" height=\"360\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Here, it’s the first option that you can see, so go ahead and click on <strong>Install Now</strong>. This may take a few seconds. Then, select <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you’re able to connect the plugin to your WordPress.com account. If you don’t have a WordPress.com account, it’s quick (and free) to set one up. Then, you can unlock the full potential of the Jetpack tool on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Create a new WordPress contact form</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have Jetpack installed on your site, you’re ready to create a new contact form. You can open an existing page to edit or, if you want to create a dedicated contact page, create a new page by going to <strong>Pages → Add New </strong>within your WordPress dashboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, just as you normally would, add a WordPress block to your page by clicking on the <strong>+ </strong>icon. Search for “form” and choose the green <strong>Form </strong>block.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image28.png\" alt=\"adding a form block into a page\" class=\"wp-image-96501\" width=\"1000\" height=\"376\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll then be able to select a template for your form. Jetpack currently supports contact forms, registration forms, feedback forms, and more. For this tutorial, we’ll use the <strong>Contact Form</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image17.png\" alt=\"selecting a contact form template\" class=\"wp-image-96502\" width=\"1000\" height=\"397\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This will create a basic contact form. Your contact form template will be visible on your page, with Name, Email, and Message fields, along with a submission button.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image4-1.png\" alt=\"default contact form template\" class=\"wp-image-96503\" width=\"1000\" height=\"469\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, click on <strong>Save</strong><em> </em>or <strong>Publish</strong><em> </em>to update your page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Customize the form fields</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mentioned above, the default Jetpack contact form fields include Name, Email, and Message. But, you can customize the form fields if you’d like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do so, simply click on the specific form field that you want to change. Then, select the field icon in the toolbar above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re changing the Name field, this icon will be labeled <strong>Name Field</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image14-1.png\" alt=\"editing the Name field in a form\" class=\"wp-image-96504\" width=\"1000\" height=\"489\" />\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you’ll see a whole list of Jetpack fields that you can replace your Name field with.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image20.png\" alt=\"list of available fields to add to a form\" class=\"wp-image-96505\" width=\"1000\" height=\"495\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You might like to swap the default fields for a website URL field, date picker, phone number field, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the change, simply click on the new field that you want to add to your form. Then, edit the field label by typing a new name in the text area.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image1-1.png\" alt=\"adding a phone number field to a form\" class=\"wp-image-96506\" width=\"1000\" height=\"488\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you can also make certain fields a requirement for your visitors to complete. To do this, select your field and click on the asterisk icon in the toolbar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, you can disable this feature by clicking on it a second time. This will make the field optional, and you’ll see that the <em>(required) </em>text beside the <strong>Name </strong>field has disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image37.png\" alt=\"making a form field required\" class=\"wp-image-96507\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To add an extra field to your form, access the WordPress blocks by clicking on the blue <strong>+ </strong>icon to the left of your screen. Then, search for “Jetpack” to view all the Jetpack form fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, simply drag your new field into position.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image19.png\" alt=\"adding a URL field to a form\" class=\"wp-image-96508\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to reorder your existing fields, use the arrows in the toolbar to move fields up or down.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image35.png\" alt=\"moving an email field down\" class=\"wp-image-96509\" width=\"1000\" height=\"492\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, click on <strong>Publish</strong><em> </em>or <strong>Save</strong><em> </em>to update your contact form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Configure the form settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you’ve customized the fields of your contact form, it’s time to configure the form settings. This way, you can determine the email address where form submissions should be sent. Additionally, you can display a thank you message to visitors that complete your form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To access your form settings, click on your Form block. It’s important to make sure that you’ve selected the entire form and not just one of your form fields. Now, in the <strong>Block</strong> settings to your right, you should find the configuration options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very top of your menu, you’ll see <strong>Manage Responses</strong>. Since you’re just building your form now, you won’t need this yet. But in the future, you can simply click on <strong>View Form Responses</strong> to view and filter form submissions in your dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image32.png\" alt=\"editing form response settings\" class=\"wp-image-96510\" width=\"1000\" height=\"484\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s move on to your <strong>Submission Settings</strong>. Here, you’ll be able to change your form display message. Simply use the <strong>On Submission </strong>dropdown box to choose <strong>Show a custom text message</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in the <strong>Message Text </strong>box, you can type your thank you message.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image36.png\" alt=\"editing form submission settings\" class=\"wp-image-96511\" width=\"1000\" height=\"496\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can use the <strong>On Submission </strong>dropdown menu to choose <strong>Redirect to another website</strong>. Then, paste the URL in the <strong>Redirect Address </strong>box.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image29.png\" alt=\"editing submission redirect\" class=\"wp-image-98690\" width=\"1000\" height=\"481\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You can also set the email address where form submissions should be sent in the <strong>Email Connection </strong>tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image26.jpg\" alt=\"email submission options\" class=\"wp-image-98691\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Here, simply add your email address to receive submissions in your inbox. You can also choose a custom email subject line for these messages. When you’re ready, click on<strong> Publish </strong>to update your form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Style the form</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you’ve created a new contact form, configured your form settings, and customized your field selections. Now you’re all set to style your form by adjusting elements like colors, fonts, sizing, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To access the stylistic settings, select one of your form fields. Then, navigate to the <strong>Block</strong> settings. Starting out in the <strong>Field Settings</strong>, you can adjust the specific field width using the available options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you might want the name and email field to appear on the same line. In which case, you can change each fields’ width to <strong>50% </strong>so that both fit on a single line.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image24.png\" alt=\"changing field widths to 50%\" class=\"wp-image-98692\" width=\"1000\" height=\"490\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that you can use the <strong>Sync fields style </strong>toggle to make sure that all fields update with the stylistic changes that you make in this section. This enables you to easily create a cohesive look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, under <strong>Color</strong>, you can set new colors for the field background, field text, label text, and border. It’s important to maintain a contrast between the background and text so that users can clearly see what they type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you can get creative with the combinations, or match the form colors to the rest of your website’s branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image9-2.png\" alt=\"form with black backgrounds and green text\" class=\"wp-image-98693\" width=\"1000\" height=\"461\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also easy to change the text size and line height of your fields under <strong>Input Field Styles. </strong>Meanwhile, <strong>Label Styles </strong>is where you can make the same changes to your field labels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you scroll down to <strong>Advanced</strong>, you’re able to add custom CSS to apply greater stylistic changes to your form. Again, select <strong>Publish </strong>to update the form with the styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Add spam protection (but avoid CAPTCHA)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing a contact form on your WordPress website has tons of worthwhile benefits. Still, it does open up your website to one major risk — spam. Not only can spammers and bots interact with your form, they can also target the email addresses that visitors supply in your form fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why it’s a good idea to install an <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/best-anti-spam-wordpress-plugins-compared/\">anti-spam plugin</a> to prevent spam on your form. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">Akismet Anti-Spam</a> is an excellent option, developed by Automattic (the team behind WordPress.com).</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image25.png\" alt=\"Akismet graphic with the text \" />\n\n\n\n<p>It integrates seamlessly with the platform as well as plenty of plugins like Jetpack. The <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet features</a> work automatically, blocking spam with a 99.99 percent accuracy rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started with Akismet, you’ll need an API key. You can get a free API key if you’re running a personal blog, but for <a href=\"https://akismet.com/documentation/getting-started/free-or-paid/\">business and commercial sites</a>, you’ll need a paid subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, you can get access to Akismet with some of <a href=\"https://cloud.jetpack.com/pricing\">Jetpack’s plans</a> like Jetpack Security, Jetpack Complete, or Jetpack Starter. Once you’ve purchased your package, all you need to do is connect your WordPress site to Jetpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet will be activated immediately, but you can check that the plugin is enabled by going to <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti-spam </strong>from your WordPress admin area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image11-1.png\" alt=\"Akismet dashboard with stats about blocked spam\" class=\"wp-image-98696\" width=\"764\" height=\"605\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you can see whether the plugin is active and view the number of spam comments that the tool has blocked. Additionally, you can configure your Akismet settings to display a privacy notice and manage spam more effectively.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting your forms from spammers and bots using Akismet is ideal because it enables you to do so without impacting the user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some sites try using <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">CAPTCHAs</a> as an alternative, this should be avoided. That’s because this adds unnecessary steps to the process and can deter visitors from filling out your form (more on this later).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Add the contact form to your site</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you’ve got your contact form ready, let’s take a look at some of the ways that you can add it to your website. For instance, you can add your form to a page. Or, you can add it to your header, footer, or sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add the form to a page (with the Block Editor)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to add your contact form to your website is to add it to one of your pages. As we’ve discussed, this is super simple to do with Jetpack, since you can add a form as a WordPress block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to do is add a new page to your site or open an existing one to edit. Then, click on the <strong>+ </strong>icon to add a new block and search for “form”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, add the <strong>Form </strong>block to your website and select the <strong>Contact Form </strong>template. Here, you’ll see the default Jetpack form fields including Name, Email, and Message.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image4-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-96503\" width=\"1000\" height=\"469\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you can configure your form settings to display a thank you message to visitors and specify the email address where you want to receive form submissions. Plus, you can apply styles to the layout to change the color and size of the form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check out how to do this in the main section of the tutorial in steps 4, 5, and 6. But at this point, click on <strong>Publish </strong>to save your contact form to your page.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add the form to a header, footer, or sidebar with a block theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to add a contact form to your header, footer, or sidebar is to use the Site Editor. In the past, you’d only be able to unlock this level of functionality using custom code, or with plugins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for some time now, the Site Editor has made it easy to get your site looking exactly the way you want. The one caveat is that to use the Site Editor, you’ll need to activate <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/\">a block theme</a>. These themes are composed entirely of WordPress blocks, enabling greater flexibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve activated a block theme, you can open the Site Editor by heading to <strong>Appearance → Editor </strong>in your dashboard. Then, click on <strong>Template Parts</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you can click on any template part, but we’re going to select <strong>Header</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image27.png\" alt=\"template parts inside of the site editor\" class=\"wp-image-98698\" width=\"1000\" height=\"469\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Next, click on the pencil icon to launch your header in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image12-1.png\" alt=\"WordPress header in the Site Editor\" class=\"wp-image-98699\" width=\"1000\" height=\"398\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, click on the <strong>+ </strong>icon to add a new block to your header. Select the Jetpack <strong>Form </strong>block.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image2-1.png\" alt=\"adding the Form block to a header\" class=\"wp-image-98700\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Then, choose <strong>Contact Form</strong>. Now, you should see the WordPress contact form template appear in your theme’s header.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image8-2.png\" alt=\"default contact form loaded into the header\" class=\"wp-image-98701\" width=\"1000\" height=\"490\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To the right of the editor, you can configure and customize your form using the instructions in steps 4, 5, and 6 of the main tutorial in this article. Meanwhile, you can edit and add fields via the toolbar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, since you have limited space, you might make your form super simple, getting rid of unnecessary fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image18.png\" alt=\"a simplified contact form in the header, with just name and email fields\" class=\"wp-image-98702\" width=\"1000\" height=\"403\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you can reduce the size of fields so that you can make your contact form fit nicely within your website header.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add the form to a header, footer, or sidebar with a classic theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the easiest way to add a WordPress contact form to your header, footer, or sidebar is to use the Site Editor. This is recommended since the Site Editor enables you to edit templates and template parts without code (or additional plugins).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you don’t want to make the switch to a block theme, you can still add a contact form to your header, footer, or sidebar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you’ll need to open the WordPress Customizer, so navigate to <strong>Appearance → Customize </strong>in your dashboard. Now, click on <strong>Widgets</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image30.png\" alt=\"opening widgets in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-98703\" width=\"1000\" height=\"508\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The widget areas that you can edit depends on the theme you’re using. For instance, some themes might give you access to your header while others only let you tweak your sidebar or footer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on your preferred widget area (like your footer) and then select the <strong>+ </strong>icon to add a new block.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image5-1.png\" alt=\"editing the WordPress footer with widgets\" class=\"wp-image-98704\" width=\"1000\" height=\"504\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Here, find the Jetpack <strong>Form </strong>block and add it to the footer. You should now see the default form layout appear in your footer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image22.png\" alt=\"adding a form to the footer\" class=\"wp-image-98705\" width=\"1000\" height=\"506\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To the left of your screen, select the <strong>Contact Form </strong>template and your footer will update instantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image33.png\" alt=\"editing a form in the footer\" class=\"wp-image-99932\" width=\"1000\" height=\"503\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you can change or add fields and mark fields as required using the toolbar. Plus, if you select the entire form block, you can select <strong>Show more settings</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you can configure a thank you message, manage form submissions, and apply stylistic settings to your form. For full details, check out sections 4, 5, and 6 of the main tutorial.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Test your contact form</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this stage, it’s important to test your form to make sure that it’s working properly. To do this, first make sure to save your latest changes. Then, click on <strong>Publish </strong>to make your form accessible to users online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you’ll need to log out of WordPress and view your website on the front end. Once you’ve logged out successfully, open a new browser window and enter your site’s URL.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve added your form to a page, you’ll need to enter the specific page URL. But, if you’ve added a contact form to your header or footer, just type your general web address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, locate your contact form on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image34.png\" alt=\"contact form on a WordPress page\" class=\"wp-image-99936\" width=\"1000\" height=\"431\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This will show how your form currently appears to visitors. To test it thoroughly, enter your own details and click on the <strong>Contact Us </strong>button.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image3-1.png\" alt=\"form with information filled out\" class=\"wp-image-99937\" width=\"1000\" height=\"437\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you should be able to see the custom thank you message that you set up in step 5 of the tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image23.png\" alt=\"thank you message on a WordPress site\" class=\"wp-image-99938\" width=\"1000\" height=\"370\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You can log back into WordPress to view the form submission. As discussed, you’ll find this information by clicking on the <strong>View Form Responses </strong>button within the editor where you created the form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can also access form submissions by going to <strong>Feedback → Form Responses </strong>in your dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image10-1.png\" alt=\"viewing form responses in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-99939\" width=\"800\" height=\"278\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you should see the test response that you submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we’ve tried to show you a highly comprehensive guide to adding a contact form in WordPress, you might still have some questions. So, let’s take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions (and answers) regarding this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there any free contact form plugins available for WordPress?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. There are plenty of free contact form plugins for WordPress including Contact Form 7 and Jetpack. While Contact Form 7 is a great choice for more experienced users to create advanced forms, Jetpack is the best content form plugin for beginners. It’s super simple to install and configure your forms. Plus, you can enable Akismet spam protection to prevent spam submissions on your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I create a contact form without a plugin?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By far, the easiest way to create a contact form in WordPress is with a plugin like Jetpack. This is because a dedicated WordPress form plugin gives you access to an intuitive form builder. This way, you can design your form visually, dragging fields where they need to sit on your page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you don’t want to use a contact form plugin, you can do it yourself using WordPress core functionality. This method is only suitable for advanced users that have some knowledge of CSS, HTML and PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you’ll be required to code all the error handling and form field validation if you decide to <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/wordpress-contact-form/\">create a contact form without a plugin</a>. This makes the manual route far more complex and time-consuming than the alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can I optimize my contact form conversion rate?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are tons of ways to optimize your WordPress contact form conversion rate. For example, you can limit the number of form fields. Then, when visitors see that your form is super quick and easy to complete, they may be more likely to convert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it’s important to make your form layout simple and clear. Plus, it’s a good idea to check that your forms are mobile-friendly. This is especially vital since over 60 percent of the global population <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/#topicOverview\">uses a mobile device to go online</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can I prevent spam submissions on my contact form?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to prevent spam submissions on your contact forms is to use an AI-powered solution like Akismet. Not only does Akismet block spam with 99.99 percent accuracy, it also enables you to maintain a smooth user experience (as opposed to alternatives like CAPTCHA).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Akismet works seamlessly with Jetpack Forms, you can install the plugin on any website (regardless of your preferred contact form plugin). All you need to do is head to <strong>Plugins → Add New.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, search for “Akismet”. Once you find Akismet Anti-Spam: Spam Protection, simply click on <strong>Install Now → Activate</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide to add a contact form in WordPress using Jetpack, you’ll see the <strong>Akismet Anti-Spam </strong>link appear beneath the <strong>Jetpack </strong>tab of your WordPress dashboard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you can set up your Akismet account, or enter the API supplied with your Jetpack plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should I use CAPTCHA on my contact form?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some website owners like to implement CAPTCHA to protect against bots. This involves adding extra steps to prevent spammers and bots from completing your forms. For instance, users might need to complete tasks, solve equations, or answer questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, there are some reasons <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">why you should avoid CAPTCHA</a>, and instead, opt for a more user-friendly alternative. For starters, these additional steps create greater friction since they require more time and effort from legitimate visitors who want to complete your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can explain why Moz found that CAPTCHA can lead to a notable <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates\">drop in conversions</a>. Meanwhile, ConvertKit discovered that you can <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">preserve a positive user experience (UX)</a> by using Akismet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is developed by Automattic (the same team behind WordPress.com). This AI-powered solution offers a non-intrusive way to block spam on your contact forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Akismet, and why should I use it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> is an easy-to-use complete solution for spam detection and prevention. Not only will the plugin block spam on your contact forms, but it will also detect and block spam from all the comment forms on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet is developed by the same team that created WordPress.com. Therefore, it works seamlessly with the platform. Better yet, rather than disrupt the UX, Akismet is a spam solution that works automatically, in the background of your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image31.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text, \" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren’t using Akismet, you’ll likely rely on solutions like CAPTCHA or <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/\">reCAPTCHA</a>. These protocols can hinder your form conversion rate since they demand more time and effort from your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, Akismet blocks spam with a 99.99 percent accuracy rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/image13-1.png\" alt=\"stats about the volume of spam that Akismet has blocked\" class=\"wp-image-99941\" width=\"1000\" height=\"572\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, over a hundred million websites actively use Akismet. It’s one of the most popular anti-spam solutions out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Akismet is trusted by some of the biggest companies in the world, including Microsoft, ConvertKit, Bluehost, and WordPress.com. What’s more, there are <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">plenty of plans</a> to choose from, so you’re sure to find an ideal solution for your website needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: AI-powered anti-spam for WordPress contact forms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a contact form, your website visitors might have to go through a lengthy, complex process to ask you a simple question. This can be frustrating and lead to a negative user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you can improve your WordPress website by adding a simple contact form. The easiest way to get started is with a contact form plugin like <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the Jetpack Form block, you can easily customize your form’s appearance, generate a thank you page, or redirect users upon submission. Plus, you can protect your business and your customers by using an anti-spam plugin like <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet enables you to prevent spam in your comments and forms, without interfering with the user experience. Better yet, it’s super simple to install and configure, since it works automatically. You’ll also get access to a feature that outright blocks spam, saving you disk space and speeding up your site. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">Check out our Enterprise solution today</a>!&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 21:45:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Kathryn Marr\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WordPress Selects Inaugural Cohort to Launch Experimental Mentorship Program\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146772\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-selects-inaugural-cohort-to-launch-experimental-mentorship-program\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3392:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; Community Team kicked off its experimental mentorship program this week, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/07/12/announcing-the-inaugural-cohort-of-the-wordpress-contributor-mentorship-program/\">announcing that the inaugural cohort</a> has been assigned to a group of mentors who will guide them forward on project contribution across various teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our mentors offer 1:1 support to each contributor in our cohort,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored Community Team contributor Hari Shanker R said. &#8220;These mentors check-in with mentees each week to offer them support and guidance on the program and to answer any questions that they may have.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentees graduate from the program after completing self-directed courses, participating in &#8220;learn-up&#8221; sessions, selecting a contributor team, and making an initial contribution to the team. Optionally, mentors may guide their mentees through a three-month contribution plan. The goal is to create new ongoing contributors through the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A group of 13 mentees have been selected from 50 applications and will participate across eight teams, including Core, Training, Community, Documentation, Photos, Test, Polyglots, and Support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While our group is not in a position to assign mentors to everyone, the activities and tasks of our cohort will be shared in the newly-formed <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C05FUD148LD\">#contributor-mentorship</a> channel of the Make/WordPress Slack, where interested folks can join most of our contributing sessions and onboarding sessions which will also be shared widely with our community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other open source projects, such as Drupal, have supported <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/community/mentoring\">mentoring programs</a> that have been used to successfully engage new contributors at events, inspire more collaboration, and foster a learning environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year the Linux Foundation <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/why-we-need-open-source-mentorship-programs-at-the-linux-foundation\">published a report</a> from a recent study on <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/mentorship-in-open-source?hsLang=en\">Mentorship in Open Source</a>. It surveyed more than 100 mentees from the LFX Mentorship graduating class of 2020 and 2021, and 99% reported the program was beneficial.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how to internationalize your WordPress code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Carrie Dils. Carrie is a WordPress loving freelance developer with modern 20 years experience in web development and full scope WordPress projects. She teaches WordPress and front-end development courses for LinkedIn learning and blogs regularly about WordPress, and the business of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another of the podcast interviews, which were recorded at WordCamp Europe in Athens. It took place soon after Carrie had completed her workshop at the event. This workshop was entitled international appeal, making your themes and plugins translatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp workshops are practical hands-on sessions. Carrie&#8217;s intention here was to make the audience aware of ways in which they could translate their code into other languages. Specifically it was to assist developers in localising their themes and plugins so that they could be consumed and understood by a wider audience. It covered translation functions for PHP and JavaScript, and a foundational understanding of how the process of localization works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started the podcast with some orientation, getting to grips with what internationalisation is in the context of WordPress. Carrie explains that there are workflows already available for developers to use to translate their plugins and themes. This enables their clients or customers to switch between languages in the admin interface so that they can understand more about what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrie talks about the fact that, although she&#8217;s not aware of any legal compulsion to carry out this internationalisation work, it&#8217;s very useful for consumers of your code. They will be able to rely on a language that&#8217;s familiar to them, and not always have to fall back on English. We get into the weeds a little as Carrie explains the foundations of how the translations actually work, and how developers can tap into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that WordPress is so popular means that it&#8217;s in a great position to make the internet a more inclusive space. Part of that is making people from all over the world. Understand how WordPress, and the tools built on top of it, works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrie says that it&#8217;s not about trying to translate every part of your plugin into the 200 plus languages which WordPress supports. It&#8217;s more about doing what you can, when you can, for those people who can benefit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrie&#8217;s talk will at some point make it onto wordpress.tv, so you can see it there for yourself, but until that&#8217;s available she lays out some of the places where you can go to get support around this subject. The plugin and theme handbooks are an ideal place to start that journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into a chat about which languages are spoken most widely and how Carrie thinks about which languages to pick. If your resources are limited. She points out that as a developer, you&#8217;re building in the capability to have your code translated, and the actual work of making those translations can be handled by others if your code is created correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that AI is always a hot topic, we digress a little towards the end about how the work of translations is likely to become more automated as large language models take on the burden of translating content and assisting in the writing of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer who is curious about making your code available to a wider audience through internationalisation, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Carrie Dils.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Carrie Dils. Hello, Carrie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:12] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Howdy, howdy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We are in Athens at the WordCamp EU celebration, 2023. Carrie&#8217;s just walked into the room and told me that she&#8217;s finished her workshop. How did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> It went well. The rooms are kind of set up classroom style, well with desk like these that we&#8217;ve got sitting in front of us, so attendees could bust out their laptops and get on the wifi and participate. And it was small enough that acoustically, if they had questions and weren&#8217;t miced, it was okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. What&#8217;s the difference between a workshop and a presentation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:42] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Well, so in theory a workshop is meant to be more hands-on, practical. Whereas a presentation is just sort of receiving information, a workshop might be actually doing something with the information that you&#8217;re getting. Workshops came in two flavors, a fifty minute and a, I guess roughly two times that, so a two hour workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in a 50 minute slot and it&#8217;s a little difficult to do anything truly interactive, and I wasn&#8217;t sure how many attendees there would be. So mine was probably closer to presentation and workshop, but I tried to throw in some interactive elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You were one of the early ones as well, so at least you&#8217;ve got it out the way. You can now enjoy the rest of the conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Right, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What was the subject?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:28] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Internationalization in WordPress. So making your plugins and your themes translatable. So basically from a coding perspective, there are functions that you can use so that if someone wanted to take all of the text strings from a theme or a plugin, and translate them into another language, they could do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So this was a talk specifically aimed at theme developers and plugin developers, as opposed to sort of end users who might use a plugin to translate their own site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Right. So the internationalization, which you might commonly hear that, with the word localization. So think of internationalization is the piece that a developer does when creating a theme or plugin. Localization is the process of then translating it into other languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be confused with multilingual websites, where the actual content of a website is translated into other language. That&#8217;s actually a different process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So is this then a process of assisting developers to ensure that their products are usable by people all over the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:36] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Exactly. So imagine, when I first started using WordPress. I didn&#8217;t know any better and you needed to do something and you just edited files directly, like edit the core files directly, edit the theme file directly. And I very quickly learned the first time I pushed that update button that it&#8217;s not meant to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you want to think about translating the software into other languages, it&#8217;s impractical to go make a duplicate code base just to change, forget your password as an English phrase into say a Spanish or a German translation of that. You don&#8217;t need to copy all of WordPress just to change that one bit of text. So the way it is written with these translation functions enables others to then go in and grab those strings without touching the original code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Do you know if there&#8217;s any jurisdictional, legal requirements to do this? So if you&#8217;re launching a product into the WordPress space, you are basically launching a product throughout the planet. Anybody can buy it anywhere. And the only two examples that cropped up into my head were, for example, in Canada where I believe everything has to be translated into French and English. If you are selling something there, if you put up signage or what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also in the UK, if you&#8217;re in Wales, Welsh and English would be another example. I didn&#8217;t know if there were guidelines around that. If you are a plugin developer, theme developer, whatever you are doing in the WordPress space where you potentially might be breaking law in different parts of the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:05] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. To my knowledge the answer is no. There are no legal requirements. It&#8217;s not like accessibility where there are laws around site accessibility. Really because we&#8217;re not necessarily talking in the case, the examples you&#8217;re giving, that&#8217;s the end user. End user facing copy. Whereas this is more behind the scenes. So imagine what you would see in WP admin, that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I guess you had to get into the thick of the code, and put coding examples up to demonstrate. And I&#8217;m also guessing that most of this is built into WordPress. You are just leveraging things that are already there, or maybe not. Maybe you are extending the functionality that ships with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:45] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> No, and it actually goes beyond WordPress. I&#8217;m going to get real nerdy on you. There is something called gettext and it is open source. It&#8217;s licensed under, GNU. I can&#8217;t say GNU without thinking of Gary Gnu that does the news from Giggle Snort Hotel. Now I&#8217;m showing my age. If you&#8217;re listening to this and are not familiar with that, this was children&#8217;s programming in the seventies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyways Gary Gnu has the news, and there is something called gettext. And this is a sort of universally recognized system for writing translatable code. WordPress uses gettext and has its own kind of wrapper functions around that. So what we&#8217;re talking about is not, while there are functions that are unique to the WordPress ecosystem, the concept of internationalizing your code goes well beyond WordPress, and WordPress uses gettext, which is what most software languages use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m guessing the fact that you&#8217;ve done a talk about it indicates that you think it&#8217;s not being used as often as it perhaps should be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> So I&#8217;m always going to come at things from a education, knowledge is power perspective. It&#8217;s quite possible that people may be listening to this and have already used, seen translation functions, and just didn&#8217;t know what they were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you see a double underscore, parenthesis and then some string of text in there, well, that double underscore parenthesis is a translation function. So it&#8217;s less about trying to convince people to use it, more educating that it exists and what are the reasons that it&#8217;s important to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress powers over 40% of the web, I think around 43% at last count. Interestingly, if you go to wordpress.org/stats, s t a t s, there&#8217;s lots of details there about WordPress installs, and one of those is what language is WordPress, what locale is being used. And I think it&#8217;s around 55% are not in English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress is global software. It&#8217;s used all around the world. And I love especially talking about this topic at WordCamp Europe, where we have so many languages, and cultures represented. And making WordPress available in around 200 different locales. And that&#8217;s the job of the Polyglots team. So if you go to make.wordpress.org, the Polyglots team is who&#8217;s in charge for making WordPress translatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s of course volunteers from all of these different locales that are bringing it to life in their language. But if you&#8217;ve ever gone to say the settings page of your WordPress admin, there&#8217;s a little box that says what language would you like your site in? If you were to choose another language, one of those 200 languages that exist, then everything in the admin will be displayed in that locale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The education piece is that it is global. It is used around the world and the process of internationalizing your code is what makes it possible to have your code exist in other languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s really easy to think about the fact that, well you and I both obviously native English speakers. More or less everything that I&#8217;ve ever endeavored to do with WordPress has been in English. If a plugin comes, or a theme comes and everything is displayed in English, I&#8217;m entirely happy. That&#8217;s fine by me. But I guess we are excluding a bunch of people for whom that obstacle is simply too high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll be presented with a bunch of options. Some of it probably in quite technical language, and if the developer hasn&#8217;t made the effort to translate it into some additional languages, I&#8217;m guessing in most cases, you&#8217;re not advocating while it&#8217;s 200 or nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:33] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe pick some low hanging fruit if you like. That&#8217;s just part of the job of WordPress. If we are going to endeavor to be truly international, that work has to be done. But how did you get interested in this? How come you are doing a presentation about this particular subject given the panoply of things that you could have picked?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:50] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> So I&#8217;ve been working with WordPress for over a decade now, and early into that I was introduced at, it was WordCamp Austin, actually, I think 2013 or 14. I was introduced to the idea of web accessibility, and specifically what accessibility looks like in WordPress. And if somebody&#8217;s listening and they&#8217;re not familiar, accessibility is basically writing both from a code perspective and from a design and presentation, really soup to nuts, your website. Making it accessible for anyone to use regardless of what kind of device they&#8217;re on, if they&#8217;re on a laptop, a mobile phone or a screen reader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So making the web accessible and I was just so glad somebody told me that that was something that was important, because I didn&#8217;t know what I didn&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So extend that idea that the mission of WordPress is to democratize publishing. Well, how do you democratize publishing to someone who doesn&#8217;t speak English and sees software, to your point, we&#8217;re happy when it&#8217;s, when it&#8217;s in English. But if you&#8217;re seeing all these technical words or, you know, whatever it is. You&#8217;re walking through the WP admin experience and it&#8217;s not in a language that you&#8217;re comfortable navigating, well then your power to publish is diminished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think of it in terms of, or I guess that&#8217;s where I got interested in it, is sort of, I don&#8217;t know that most people would consider it a branch of accessibility, but in my mind it&#8217;s related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So let&#8217;s imagine that I&#8217;ve been listening to this and found it persuasive. Okay, I&#8217;ve got a plugin, I&#8217;ve got a theme, what have you. But I&#8217;ve made no effort to translate anything. And I think, okay, I should. I should begin this journey. How straightforward is it? Does WordPress provide the tools and the infrastructure and the file types and whatever else is going on? Is it fairly easy to drop into this? Is there documentation which is up to date to make it straightforward? Or is this one of those impossibly difficult to find pieces of documentation? And if it&#8217;s easy to find, where is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:53] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question, and it&#8217;s easy to find. So if you go toward wordpress.org, there&#8217;s the plugin handbook, and there&#8217;s also the theme handbook. And both of those handbooks have sections on how to internationalize your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to take your question a step further. As someone who is creating products to be distributed maybe for, you know, you&#8217;re selling your theme or your plugin. Writing your code in a way that it can be translated into other languages, increases your user base. It makes it accessible to people in other places, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as the plugin or theme developer, I don&#8217;t necessarily have to go, my job is to write my code in a way that it can be translated. Other people can do their translations. I don&#8217;t have to necessarily ship my code with a ton of translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are not suggesting that the burden to get these 200 languages out there is always going to be on the shoulders of the developer. You could ship something and let the community take it over. If this was an important plugin that you developed, which it turns out 40% of all WordPress websites wish to use, it could be a community effort to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:02] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Absolutely. If your customer base is international, then you might want to ship it, you know, with language packs, or the translations for, the locales where your customers live. That would just be common sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a little bit off piste, which languages would you say, matter is the wrong word, but do you know what I mean? So obviously English has become the lingua franca of WordPress. By default Most things happen in English. And we come to this event, and although we are in Athens, everything&#8217;s largely in English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the languages which seem to dominate internationally that you would say, okay, if you&#8217;re a developer and you wish to get your things translated, do these ones first, because you&#8217;ll have the biggest reach. Now obviously if your product is designed for Hungarian users, probably Hungarian&#8217;s the first one to go for. But broadly speaking, if you&#8217;re just trying to open it up to the world, English, and then where do we go from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:55] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Well, as I was doing some research for my session, I was looking statistically, I think about 13% and please, anybody listening to this that says she is very wrong right now. I acknowledge that I am probably very wrong right now. But I&#8217;m going to say it&#8217;s maybe 13% of the world&#8217;s population speaks English. Making it one of the largest, but not the largest. And again, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m about to say something wrong, I think Chinese, specifically Cantonese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To your question, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. I think it would be more about what market are you trying to go after. I had the experience, maybe seven or eight years ago, of releasing a commercial theme. One of the goals I was trying to accomplish was, one, to create a theme that was accessible, and two, to create a theme that was translation ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was a learning experience for me, and I was able to collaborate. I put out a call to my network, to friends that don&#8217;t speak English natively, and asked them for translations. So I ended up shipping my theme with, I want to say eight to ten different translations ready to roll. And some of those, this was the particularly interesting bit for me, some of those are scripts that read right to left, versus read left to right, like English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So depending on, I&#8217;m about to blow your mind, Nathan. Depending on the language, you may need to make layout changes to the front end of the site. So imagine you&#8217;ve got a content right sidebar for a site. Well, if you are switching to a right to left script like Hebrew, or Arabic. You would then detect if the language was loaded in one of these RTL scripts and reverse the layout accordingly. So there&#8217;s like a separate CSS file for rTL scripts. Isn&#8217;t that kind of fascinating?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is really fascinating actually, and also probably quite a bit of additional work. That&#8217;s my next question actually. We live in a very commercial WordPress now. I think if you and I were having this conversation 10 years ago, the whole commercial side of WordPress was far less significant. There&#8217;s now a lot of money tied up in WordPress. And you alluded earlier to this, you said that you could, you can open up your plugin, theme, whatever it may be, to a wider audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess somebody listening to this might want to know, okay, how much work is this and what&#8217;s the payback? Is it easy to do this? If I pick these two or three popular languages, will I be able to achieve this in a matter of days? Do I need to employ professional transcribers or translators. And will I receive a return on by investment? Like I said, this question probably wouldn&#8217;t have occurred 10 years ago. Do you understand the motivation for this might be quite low on the pecking order?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:44] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Yes. So it&#8217;s relatively low effort, Nathan. So think of, as developers, there are best practices for the way that we write code. Maybe it&#8217;s the way that we structure our comment. I mean, there are actually WordPress coding standards for how things should be formatted and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So using translation functions in your code is really just the best practice. It&#8217;s low effort to do as a developer. It&#8217;s very approachable. And again, the burden of doing the translations into other languages, you don&#8217;t necessarily have to do that piece, but of course that, if you know that you have a user base in a particular locale, it would probably behoove you to provide those translations out of the gate with your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in terms of what&#8217;s the return, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. I don&#8217;t have any statistics that speak to that. But certainly from a goodwill aspect, that is there. And also, take away some of the arrogance factor, acknowledging that there are users that may be using your product that are not native English speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just providing that as part of your code base is a pretty, I don&#8217;t want to say easy, because that&#8217;s an overused word. It depends on who you are if it&#8217;s easy. But if you are already a WordPress developer used to writing code, chances are you&#8217;ve copy and pasted a translation function, or a texturing that was wrapped in a translation function and maybe you didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is June in 2023, so it&#8217;s impossible to have a conversation without the words AI. Will there be a place for AI in this? Because it does seem, the burden may not be the coding side. It may literally be, well we haven&#8217;t got the finances to get the text translated. We don&#8217;t have any expertise in that area, and we don&#8217;t know people who can speak Hebrew, Arabic, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a cost to that. I&#8217;m just wondering if that might well be brought down by things like AI. I&#8217;m thinking, you know, you can throw things into Google Translate and out it comes with the correct answer. I just wonder what your thoughts are on that. Whether that&#8217;s going to assist this endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I can imagine, I can really imagine a future in which we go to ChatGPT, or some variant thereof, and say translate my site&#8217;s admin area into Hungarian, for example. And it will wrap all the functions correctly and do it all for you. That sounds like a, possible future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:08] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> I think so I have done zero experimentation in that regard, but I don&#8217;t see why it couldn&#8217;t. Because you can train AI, right? So if you&#8217;re training it on specifically what these functions are, and how you use them. I don&#8217;t know why it couldn&#8217;t take and theoretically generate both the code. And then on the translation side, to your point, Google Translate already exists. I think the issue right now at least at this stage with AI translations, you lose context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So imagine, I gave this example in my workshop, so the word lead, L E A D in English has multiple meanings. I could be leading a presentation. I could get a sales lead for my product. I could have my dog on a leash, and it&#8217;s called a lead. So if you were just to tell Google Translate, hey translate the word lead into these 10 languages, who knows. There&#8217;s a reason for the phrase lost in translation. So I think probably that&#8217;s the first shortcoming I could see with the current state of affairs. Obviously, I think that could be addressed and would be really interesting to see what the applications are with AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it just feels like a fairly decent shortcut. In that, given everything that we&#8217;ve said before about how it would be, well, I&#8217;m going to use the word honorable. It would be an honorable thing to do to translate your plugin into the 200 plus languages that WordPress can accept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I realize in most cases that&#8217;s probably off the table. But if technology could assist in that effort, and you did have the time to double check to make sure that lead meant lead and not lead, if you know what I mean. Then that seems like a win-win because there&#8217;s just no downside to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:53] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Exactly. Nobody ever cried because your site was faster or more accessible. Yeah, so it&#8217;s doing that. There&#8217;s not really a downside to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Where would you direct us? I&#8217;m a plugin developer, a theme developer. You have mentioned the handbook, but I wonder if there&#8217;s other things out there. So there might be, I don&#8217;t know, YouTube channels or other documentation, maybe some books or something that you&#8217;ve written. I don&#8217;t know. Is there anything else that you would point people towards? And I will include whatever you say into the show notes so people can just click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:21] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> I can provide you with a handful of articles on my site that I&#8217;ve written. I also have a class if I, just shameless plug, a course on LinkedIn learning on this topic, where I&#8217;m teaching more specifically exactly what these translation functions are. When you would use them, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also met a gentleman this morning, Toby, whose last name I didn&#8217;t catch, but he&#8217;s presenting tomorrow on the same topic. And then of course in theory the workshop will end up on TV?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So by the time this podcast episode airs, typically, the WordPress TV won&#8217;t have caught up to that, but should it change at some point in the future, I will make the effort to update the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing which people have in mind when we talk about translations in WordPress is Gutenberg&#8217;s stage four. Now, I realize there&#8217;s not a perfect overlap here because that&#8217;s more about changing the, well, my understanding, at least anyway, is that&#8217;s more about changing the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you feel more broadly, the WordPress project more generally, in terms of accessibility and being able to read it in different languages? I know that&#8217;s a way off. It feels like three, phase three that we&#8217;re in at the moment could take decade or more to actually finish. I mean, it&#8217;s quite complicated, the concurrent editing, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But are you fairly bullish that WordPress is going to be at the vanguard of this in the future? I know that we&#8217;ve been talking about the internals, the plugins and what have you, but broadly speaking, on the front end, how do you feel about phase four?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:46] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> I won&#8217;t overstep my bounds and pretend like I know more than I do about it. That said, when Matt laid out the four phases of Gutenberg, however many years ago that was. The project has continued to follow that roadmap, albeit maybe not at the quickest clip. So I have faith that will happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:04] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> At some point in the future. And that that works towards the WordPress mission of democratizing publishing. I don&#8217;t know exactly what, practically speaking, what shape that takes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, here&#8217;s a resource for you, and people who would know. Polyglots, I mentioned them earlier, the Make WordPress team. They have a Slack channel. They have weekly meetings. If you were to go to the Polyglot section on wordpress.org, that would probably be the place to tune in and, they would have much better information than me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Carrie, you&#8217;ve been very helpful. You&#8217;ve provided me with a question. I know that you wanted to mention that there&#8217;s been some updates recently. Well not recently, fairly long time ago, five years I think you mentioned, in the way that you can actually implement these things. You mentioned that it was only possible in PHP until five years ago, something like that. But now you can do this in JavaScript if that&#8217;s your thing. Talk to us about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:55] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Yes. So earlier I mentioned the gettext library, sort of the standard for writing translation functions. And that&#8217;s common across many programming languages. WordPress is written primarily in PHP and JavaScript. And up until WordPress 5.0, there was no mechanism for translating JavaScript, only for translating strings that were included in PHP files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, behold. If you love JavaScript and you love to learn JavaScript deeply, now you can also learn to translate, or include translatable strings in, your JavaScript. And they&#8217;re actually, it&#8217;s a subset of the functions that are available in PHP, but they work identically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And so all of that&#8217;s again, in the documentation. If we go to the resources in the show notes, we&#8217;ll be able to find all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:42] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Absolutely, yes. The handbooks are really, it might take you a little bit of digging around or jumping, jumping around pages, but yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Carrie, thank you so much for talking to us today. Before we part ways, if somebody has listened to this, is interested, wants to find out more, but wants to come directly to you, how do they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:01] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Twitter is probably where I hang out the most, and my handle is super simple, c d i l s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You got in early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:10] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Yes, I&#8217;ve been on for quite a while. And then I&#8217;m also on Mastodon, on the wpbuilds.social @cdils.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Carrie Dils, really appreciate you talking to us today. Thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of the conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:24] <strong>Carrie Dils:</strong> Thank you, Nathan. Great chatting with you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cdils\">Carrie Dils</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrie is a WordPress-loving freelance developer with more than twenty years experience in web development, and full-scope WordPress projects. She teaches WordPress and front-end development courses for LinkedIn Learning, and blogs regularly about WordPress and the business of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another of the podcast interviews which were recorded at WordCamp Europe in Athens. It took place soon after Carrie had completed her workshop at the event. This workshop was entitled ‘International Appeal: Making Your Themes and Plugins Translatable’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp workshops are practical, hands-on, sessions. Carrie’s intention here was to make the audience aware of ways in which they could translate their code into other languages. Specifically it was to assist developers in localising their themes and plugins so that they could be consumed and understood by a wider audience. It covered translation functions for PHP and JavaScript, and a foundational understanding of how the process of localisation works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started the podcast with some orientation; getting to grips with what internationalisation is in the context of WordPress. Carrie explains that there are workflows already available for developers to use to translate their plugins and themes. This enables their clients or customers to switch between languages in the admin interface so that they can understand more about what they’re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrie talks about the fact that, although she’s not aware of any legal compulsion to carry out this internationalisation work, it’s very useful for consumers of your code. They will be able to rely on a language that’s familiar to them, and not always have to fall back on English. We get into the weeds a little as Carrie explains the foundations of how the translations actually work, and how developers can tap into this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that WordPress is so popular means that it’s in a great position to make the internet a more inclusive space. Part of that is making people from all over the world understand how WordPress, and the tools built on top of it, works. Carrie says that it’s not about trying to translate every part of your plugin into the two hundred plus languages which WordPress supports, it’s more about doing what you can, when you can, for those people who can benefit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrie’s talk will at some point make it onto WordPress.tv so you can see it for yourself, but until that’s available she lays out some of the places where you can go to get support around this subject. The plugin and theme handbooks are an ideal place to start that journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into a chat about which languages are spoken most widely, and how Carrie thinks about which languages to pick if your resources are limited. She points out that as a developer you’re building in the capability to have your code translated, and the actual work of making those translations can be handled by others if your code is created correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that AI is always a hot topic, we digress a little towards the end about how the work of translations is likely to become more automated as large language models take on the burden of translating content and assisting in the writing of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer who is curious about making your code available to a wider audience through internationalisation, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cdils\">Carrie&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpbuilds.social/@cdils\">Carrie&#8217;s Mastodon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://carriedils.com/\">Carrie&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/\">gettext project</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress stats</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-internationalization-22343157\">LinkedIn Learning course by Carrie</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/session/enable-truly-global-use-of-your-code-avoid-the-typical-i18n-pitfalls/\">Tor-Björn Fjellner&#8217;s WCEU presentation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress plugin handbook</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/\">WordPress theme handbook</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/about/\">Polyglots team</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"Do The Woo Community: New Sponsorship Opportunity, WordCamp Media Friend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75545\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://dothewoo.io/new-sponsorship-opportunity-wordcamp-media-friend/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:420:\"<p>If you are sponsoring either WordCamp Europe, US or Asia we can help you get the word out pre-, post- and during the event.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

When you click the &#8220;Edit Site&#8221; link in the admin bar from a category page, for example, you currently get dumped out into the Site Editor on the home page. From here it&#8217;s several clicks more to get to the template you intended to edit. The upcoming release changes it so that <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56209\">the &#8220;Edit Site&#8221; link is aware of the current template</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developer <a href=\"https://www.briancoords.com/\">Brian Coords</a> pointed out the fix on Twitter today. It&#8217;s a delightful bit of good news for anyone who works regularly with the Site Editor and becomes annoyed by how long it takes to click through to the applicable template. WordPress is now more context aware, delivering site editors to the correct template directly from the admin bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excited about this feature coming in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> 6.3: <br />The \"Edit Site\" link will now send you to edit the actual template you\'re looking at instead of always going to the home page. <a href=\"https://t.co/ztwMrDkSZC\">https://t.co/ztwMrDkSZC</a></p>&mdash; Brian Coords (@briancoords) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/briancoords/status/1678760162017042435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The update applies to posts, pages, archives, 404 templates, front page, and anywhere the user happens to be on the frontend.

The more WordPress can reduce friction and the need to have special knowledge in order to edit templates, the more accessible it becomes as a design tool for someone who is just starting out and has no framework for the idea of underlying templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.3 is on track to be released with this fix on August 8, 2023. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/wordpress-6-3-beta-4/\">Beta 4 landed today</a> with 40+ (Editor) and 60+ (Trac) updates since Beta 3, and RC 1 is expected next week.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 21:59:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.3 Beta 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15386\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/wordpress-6-3-beta-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5669:\"<p>WordPress 6.3 Beta 4 is ready for download and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development.</strong> <strong>Please do not install, run, or test this version on production or mission-critical websites.</strong> Instead, you should evaluate Beta 4 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-3/\">6.3 release cycle</a>, check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-3/\">6.3-related posts</a>, and review the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/wordpress-6-3-beta-2/\">new features in WordPress 6.3</a>.

WordPress security researcher Calvin Alkan said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Requests are authentication by comparing a shared secret stored as plaintext in the WordPress database to the one provided by MalCare’s remote application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This can allow attackers to completely take over the site because they can impersonate MalCare’s remote application and perform any implemented action.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These potential malicious actions include creating rogue admin users, uploading random files to the site, and installing and removing plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exploitation requires a pre-condition to be met, such as a site with a SQL injection vulnerability in a plugin, theme, or WordPress core, or a database compromised at the hosting level, or subject to another vulnerability that allows the attacker to read or update WordPress options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;MalCare has received the full details of this vulnerability three months before this public release, and despite us offering (free) help, they subtly dismissed it because &#8216;supposedly&#8217; this is the industry standard for API authentication,&#8221; Alkan said.<br /><br />&#8220;Furthermore, concerns were raised, because the vulnerability requires a pre-condition that on its own, would be a vulnerability.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two days after Snicco published the security advisory with the proof of concept, <a href=\"https://www.malcare.com/blog/malcare-update-improved-authentication/\">MalCare pushed a patch</a> in version 5.16 on July 8, 2023, along with a notice on the plugin&#8217;s blog:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>In the rare situation, where a site has a pre-existing, high severity SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker might be able to read the MalCare key. To address such issues, we are further strengthening our authentication systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authentication is a critical system and any improvements must be done in a careful manner. We have reviewed various plugins and best practices in our ecosystem to come up with our solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of the current public discourse, we are expediting the update of our plugin. We will initiate a rollout by EOD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MalCare reports that its users have seen no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snicco noted that the same vulnerability also exists in WPRemote (20k installs) and Blogvault (100k installs) plugins, as they share the same code.

WordPress 6.3 is set to be the final major release of Phase 2, which focused on Customization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase 3 will shift focus from the editors and move into other parts of the admin in an effort to bring seamless collaboration to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The primary aim of real-time collaboration is to build functionality into the&nbsp;block&nbsp;editors so that concurrent collaboration, shared edits, and online presence of peers are possible,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Supporting these workflows is not just about concurrency, though, but also about lifting restrictions that have been present in WordPress for a long time, such as locking a post when two people try to edit at the same time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical challenges here are in making this available to all WordPress users, even those on the most economical hosting environments. Ventura shared a quick preview of what that might look like, along with the scope of the tasks that would be part of this effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/\">Workflows</a> document, Ventura details collaborative features that will be part of this phase, including allowing users to add comments, suggest edits, and tag other users for peer review. These enhancements would apply to both content creation and design changes on block themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some interesting projects listed within the scope of this section, including a publishing checklist, sharing draft links with permission controls, and exploring hook points for&nbsp;version control&nbsp;systems to take over internal revision systems if desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/\">Workflows</a> &#8211; Matías Ventura\n\n\n\n<p>Users can expect that <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">Revisions</a> will also be getting some major improvements as part of the Collaboration phase of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As part of improving the overall experience, we should also go beyond document level history and explore how the interface could let users browse through single block changes and offer the ability to restore them individually rather than requiring full post restores,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;For global styles, we should evolve the revisions panel to allow comparing two revisions side by side. For synced patterns, we could allow browsing edit history with side by side and overlay comparison tools.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-awaited improvements to WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/07/media-library/\">Media Library</a> are also considered part of this phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The main goals are to expand the media management capabilities, unify the block edit and single media interfaces, and improve upon the major media flows,&#8221; Ventura said. He highlighted a few major areas that may get some enhancements, such as categorization and tagging, better handling of attached media, and design improvements to the library view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Media Library projects may include a revamp of the image editing interface, which remains somewhat unintuitive at this time. Ventura proposes these tools, such as cropping and thumbnail browsing, be updated to align more with the current block editor tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors may also be exploring contribution to the commons from WordPress, along with improvements to attribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As we look into expanding the presence and touch points of <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, it’d be interesting to see how contributions to the commons could work directly from a user’s WordPress install,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Another area to look at is improving handling and presentation of other media types (audio, video, files) and their connection with blocks and the block APIs. We should resurface work on a native Playlist block, ideally powered by the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\">Interactivity API</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reactions to the outlined vision and scope for the Collaboration phase have so far been positive, as users and contributors are eager to see a strong focus come to some of the other parts of WordPress that have not had much attention for years. The newer real-time collaboration features that will take WordPress beyond the days of locking posts while another person is editing, have the potential to speed up content creation and editing for groups working on the same website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Very much looking forward to this phase. I think it will really enable larger teams to work on posts much easier,&#8221; WordPress developer Rich Holman <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/03/real-time-collaboration/#comment-45051\">commented</a>. &#8220;I’ve mentioned this before but the ability to continue working on a published draft without the front-end updating seems important especially with more editors working on something, especially if doing more experimental edits.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details on the features being considered for this phase, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Phase 3 overview post</a>, along with Ventura&#8217;s more recent write-ups on how contributors will improve and expand WordPress&#8217; collaboration architecture with updates to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/03/real-time-collaboration/\">Real-Time Collaboration</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/04/workflows/\">Workflows</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">Revisions</a>, and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/07/media-library/\">Media Library</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Jul 2023 19:40:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"WordCamp Central: WordCamp Rochester is Back!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3166570\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/07/wordcamp-rochester-is-back/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1772:\"<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2023/07/cropped-14120055196ucu6-scaled-1-1.jpg\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, September 30, 2023, Rochester will again (for the sixth time) host the region’s WordCamp for bloggers and web designers of all skill levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registration opens at 8:00am.

It&#8217;s the kind of simple theme that enables you to quickly get started writing online, without having to configure a bunch of design elements. The homepage features a profile image (Site Logo), site title, and recent posts with dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Single posts display with the feature image at the top of the post, although this template can easily be edited if this is an undesirable feature. Previous and Next post navigation appears under the post. Users can add menu items to display at the top, but clicking the site logo brings the visitor back home in the absence of a navigation menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Hey theme comes in two different styles &#8211; the default and a serif variation. Colors can be adjusted to create a more vibrant palette for the site design.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>One major drawback to this theme, which may not be immediately evident by looking at the demo, is that if users want to display more than the three most recent posts, they will need to add the pagination block inside the query loop block. It will also need to be styled to match the theme better. The query loop can be edited to show more posts on the homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Hey is a simple personal blog theme, it also comes packaged with templates for WooCommerce compatibility. This is likely for the benefit of WordPress.com users who may want to quickly fire up a store. Self-hosted users who want to sell products with WooCommerce will be able to easily display things like the mini-cart, customer account block, product archive, product search results, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Hey is an elegantly simple block theme with a clean design and plentiful white space. It&#8217;s suitable for the person who wants an almost blank slate to get started, or just a theme that enables writing without any distraction for the reader.

Now that usage of PHP 5.6 is well below that at 3.9% and dropping by around 0.1% every few weeks, plans to increase the minimum supported PHP version can move forward.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackbourn also emphasized that WordPress&#8217; support for PHP 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 is &#8220;very good&#8221; and contributors may soon act on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/06/20/proposal-criteria-for-removing-beta-support-from-each-php-8-version/\">a proposal for the criteria that would enable them to remove the &#8220;beta&#8221; support label</a> on new PHP versions. Nearly 26% of WordPress users are already running sites on PHP 8.0+. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to this minimum required version boost, some hosts had even taken matters into their own hands in urging users to get on newer versions of PHP. Dreamhost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/idavinder/status/1673948104591122432\">charges additional fees</a> for sites that require <a href=\"https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004672631-PHP-extended-support\">extended support</a> for PHP 7.4 and older. <a href=\"https://www.ionos.com/help/hosting/troubleshooting-for-php/php-extended-support/\">IONOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strato-hosting.co.uk/faq/hosting/what-is-strato-php-extended-support/\">Strato</a> have similar policies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to bump the minimum supported version is happening after a lengthy seven-month long <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57345\">discussion</a>, which surprisingly <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57345#comment:93\">drew a little resistance</a>. Although sites that remain on PHP 5.6 cannot upgrade beyond WordPress 6.2, they will still receive security updates, as the project currently <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/security/2022/09/07/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\">backports them to versions 4.1+</a>. The bump to 7.0.0 for the minimum supported version will have many benefits for the WordPress ecosystem of themes and plugins, will significantly reduce memory usage for upgraded websites, and provide better security and improvements to core tooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are no plans to bump the minimum supported PHP version on a schedule,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;The core team will continue to monitor usage of PHP versions and work with the hosting team to encourage users and hosting companies to upgrade their versions of PHP as swiftly as possible. The 5% usage baseline will continue to be used for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 21:30:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.3 Beta 3 Released, Introduces UI Changes to Pattern Management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=146527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-3-beta-3-released-introduces-ui-changes-to-pattern-management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3172:\"<p>WordPress contributors are onto another round of testing, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/wordpress-6-3-beta-3/\">6.3 Beta 3 was released</a> this week. RC 1 is expected on July 18, and a live product demo is anticipated to be broadcast on Thursday, July 20, 2023 at 16:00 UTC. These demos have become a more regular part of the release process and allow viewers to familiarize themselves with important new features and updates coming in the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 3 includes approximately 34 updates to the Site Editor since the previous beta release, and more than 40 updates coming from Trac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A last-minute PR has <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52102\">renamed Library to Patterns</a> in the Site Editor and was cherry-picked to get it included in Beta 3. Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Aaron Robertshaw cited three reasons for the renaming:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Discovery: this is an opportunity to make patterns front and center as we are introducing the ability to save custom patterns. They should be front and center in the &#8220;Design&#8221; tab.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clarity: library can be obscure and overlaps with other terminology (like Media Library). We didn&#8217;t get to add font library management in this round, but it would have made things more confusing (would a user expect to see their font library under &#8220;Styles&#8221; or an item called &#8220;Library&#8221;?). Calling it patterns removes that ambiguity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Presence: patterns is a unique name that has been established in the WP branding parlance for a bit and deserves more clear placement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This video from the PR gives a quick overview of the changes testers should see in the Patterns UI as of Beta 3:</p>\n\n\n\nGutenberg PR: Patterns: Rename Library to Patterns <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/52102\">#52102</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 3 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51990\">introduces a new lock icon</a> to designate theme patterns as unable to be edited or modified. It also adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51954\">sync status details section</a> within the pattern sidebar navigation screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/51990\">Gutenberg PR #51990</a>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a significant number of new things being introduced after Beta 1, which seems usual. Major features like the pattern creation and the Patterns section made their debut in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-16-1-introduces-pattern-creation-and-library-adds-distraction-free-mode-to-site-editor\">Gutenberg 16.1</a> but had very little testing before being rolled into the upcoming WordPress 6.3 release.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcastwhich is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how and why you need to be thinking sustainably when building websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Louise Towler. She joined me at the recent WordCamp Europe in Athens to talk about websites and making them more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise is the founder of Indigo Tree, a UK based agency with deep expertise in WordPress websites. She gave a presentation at WordCamp Europe entitled, Digital sustainability: The benefits for business and the environment, in which she emphasized the impact websites can have on our planet. Her aim was to deliver practical tips for users and developers to help them make informed decisions. This presentation is the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, and we cover quite a lot of ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise highlights the significant role which electricity plays in powering data centers and transmitting data to end devices. Even if data centers use renewable energy, there is still a need to address overall electricity consumption. She points out that the internet is the fourth largest polluter globally, surpassing the airline industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed how the continuous and widespread use of the internet has made it difficult to reduce its own impact, while still emphasizing the importance of the steps that we can take to make the internet more energy efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests ways that we can all make a difference right away. Educating clients about the consequences of certain design choices, such as using large videos or auto-play features that require substantial data to load. Optimizing videos, images, and other website elements, which makes it possible to reduce data consumption and improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then explores other suggestions, such as using modern image formats, using images as placeholders for videos, self hosted fonts, and considering the carbon footprint of email communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise acknowledges the challenges of discussing environmental concerns with clients, whilst also explaining that we have to come up with ways to make clients understand that these decisions are beneficial to them as well. After all, an optimized website is one that is looked upon favorably by search engines. Whilst clients ultimately are the decision makers, informing them about the consequences of their choices can help them be more informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving onto WordPress, we talk about the responsibility theme authors play. It&#8217;s a crucial role, helping users make sustainable choices. Her agency builds custom themes for clients which allows them to have full control over design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the subject of how legislation is certainly coming, and so getting in early and understanding the implications of such legislation will help your endeavors in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we chat about some of the tools which you can use to assess the impact that your websites have, including a tool which Louise and her team have been working on for the last few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in how your sites can become more sustainable, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Louise Towler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Louise Towler. Hi Louise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Thank you for inviting me. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re going to talk today about, well possibly the most important topic ever, which is the environment and your website compared to the environment. Prior to that Louise, will you just tell us a little bit about you, so that we have some context. Who are you? What&#8217;s your relationship with WordPress and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Okay. I am the founder of Indigo Tree. We&#8217;re a small but beautiful WordPress agency based about 30 minutes on the train north of London in the UK. There&#8217;s 15 of us in total at the moment. We have an engineering team, a project management team, and a support team, and we build WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started building websites, well my first webpage that I built was built Christmas Day, the year 2000, because my husband was daft enough to buy me a book on html. So he cooked the turkey and I built myself a little webpage. I started freelancing about 20 years ago, and then one of my freelancing clients said to me, we&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s this thing called WordPress. Would you mind building our website in WordPress? And I was like, okay, I&#8217;ll give it a go. And went off and Googled and found out how to do it, and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. You did a talk today entitled The Benefits for Business and the Environment. Just give us a bit of a background about your thoughts on the environment. What I mean by that, is this something that you are concerned about in your normal life? Does the environment figure heavily in your daily life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It does. It&#8217;s really difficult to tread lightly on the planet. It&#8217;s very hard to do things in a sustainable way, but I think I&#8217;m very conscious of it. So I buy a few clothes, but I wear them a lot rather than throw them away, and the fast fashion thing. I use recycled paper. I try to do things in a good way. Turn off lights. Think about my travel. But it is genuinely hard. But then I have children and they&#8217;re going to live a lot longer than me, and global warming is going to affect them a lot more than it&#8217;s going to affect me. But 2050 is not that far away. And we are in trouble, as we can see by the mad world weather that&#8217;s happening at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You work in the website building industry, as do I. Which feels in my daily interaction with my computer, it feels like the cleanest thing ever. I have a shiny laptop. I have a shiny phone. None of them put smoke out of the back when I switched them on. You know, if I worked in the automotive industry, it would be obvious what my footprint was. But I switch on my computer, there&#8217;s no connection between that and the environment. And yet it&#8217;s pretty bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We browse the internet. We&#8217;re probably asking Google and all the other rivals, trivial things all the time. So make the connection for us. What is the environmental impact? What are the things which are happening between me switching on my computer and browsing WordPress websites? What are the things that are going on? What&#8217;s the technology, the bits and pieces that we need to be thinking about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, if the internet was a country, it would be the fourth largest polluter. Compared to airlines, you know, that are 1.6%, it&#8217;s massive. It is just massive. And it&#8217;s fundamentally about electricity. Because it&#8217;s electricity that powers the data centers, whether or not they&#8217;re running on renewable energy, the fact is they still need electricity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve got the transmission, the wires between the data centers and the end devices, and then you&#8217;ve got the power to power your device. If you&#8217;re on a phone, you are recharging it. If you&#8217;re on a laptop, you are plugging it in, and that&#8217;s all using electricity. And not all of that electricity is renewable and the electricity that comes through the wires, you don&#8217;t have any control about what proportion of that is renewable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a hot, windy day in the UK, a vast proportion of that electricity is from renewable energy, from solar and wind turbines. But on a dark, gloomy day with no wind, a massive proportion of that is fossil fuel powered electricity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It feels like we&#8217;re completely addicted to the internet. I use the car that I have, a bit. But I use the internet more or less continually. You know, I&#8217;ve got my phone, it&#8217;s constantly charged up. The merest thought in my head can easily lead me to whip out the phone, do some banal scrolling of Facebook or whatever it may be. And that feels like that&#8217;s crept up on us. We&#8217;re all using it all the time. You said what was it, 4%?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It&#8217;s the fourth largest polluter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Fourth largest polluter. Can you compare that to another industry? You mentioned airlines. Does the internet as a whole, so every website, all the online services that we can use and so on, does that pollute more than the airline industry? Because the airline industry is the poster child of pollution, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I believe it does. I mean, the problem is finding out, and even measuring it is really hard. So all the estimates are that it is just massive, and it&#8217;s getting worse. With AI, the stat that I&#8217;ve read is that to do a search in ChatGPT takes four times as much energy as to do a search in Google. And to build that AI model takes a massive amount of processing power to suck in all the data and build out that model that then does predict the next word that&#8217;s going to come out in the chat box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s not getting better. When you are talking about carbon footprints and getting to net zero, you&#8217;ve not just got to change the energy mix so that you&#8217;re running off renewable energy. You need to actually reduce demand. In the UK there&#8217;s a carbon reduction in task force. Their target is by 2030, they will have reduced demand by 15% for electricity in comparison to 2021. You have to reduce the demand as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> And the connection to IT and websites is that if you transmit less data, you are, there&#8217;s not a direct correlation always, but you are essentially using less electricity to transmit that data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the easiest way to mitigate your use of the internet is just to stop using it. But that&#8217;s completely unrealistic now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:44] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, a company with zero carbon footprint is probably a company that&#8217;s not in business. You can&#8217;t not use the internet. What you have to do, we have to try and make sure the internet uses less electricity to do what it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so given that we&#8217;re not going to be switching our computers off, we&#8217;re not going back to the internet stone age, if you like. We&#8217;ve got to figure out ways to reduce the amount of carbon that we put out. So we&#8217;ve got to become responsible citizens because we&#8217;re using the internet. But also, we&#8217;re in a slightly unique position, you, I, and the people listening to this podcast, because we&#8217;re sitting behind the websites that are causing the pollution. And that&#8217;s, I guess, where the rest of this conversation is going to go. What are the things that we can do to make our websites for our clients, for ourselves, pollute a little bit less?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:38] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Think about the data and educate your client. So in the first instance, if your client wants that amazing stock video on the banner of their homepage, that auto plays in the background and looks absolutely fab. But actually the amount of data that you are then having to load on the homepage to deliver that video is massive. Well explain to them the consequences of that decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;ll probably mean the homepage is a little bit slower, which won&#8217;t be as good for Core Web Vitals and for search. So whether or not they care about the planet, they should be caring about the performance of their website. And the fact is it will use more data and that&#8217;s not good for people or the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m on a fixed price data plan, because I&#8217;m on a low income and my children&#8217;s school has a massive video on the homepage of their school website with lots of happy kids running around the playground. And every time I visit that website, I&#8217;m using up my scarce resources of data, auto playing that video, that&#8217;s not very respectful to me when I&#8217;m trying to go about my daily life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s lots of levels you can talk to your clients about why it&#8217;s good to do things. So it&#8217;s things like optimizing videos, optimizing images. If you&#8217;re familiar with Core Web Vitals and trying to speed up websites, these are nothing new. But you know, design your website with two fonts rather than five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about when you embed videos on the page. The block editor, it&#8217;s really easy to embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo, but use a plugin and put a facade in front of it so that when you actually load the page it loads an image. If it&#8217;s below the fold, you can lazy load the image. If people don&#8217;t scroll down, the image doesn&#8217;t load, and it&#8217;s only when they click on that image that the video plays and actually downloads that extra data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you are being really respectful to your visitors as well as to the planet by consciously thinking about these things. And it doesn&#8217;t cost anymore if you plan it in from the beginning. Talking to your clients and planning it, most clients are really happy to have that conversation because in the end, performance and speed should increase conversions and profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Actually, that&#8217;s a really good point. You mentioned, just as we were beginning, that you run an agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have this conversation with your clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:03] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I talk about performance and speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so how does that go down?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you ever had somebody push back and say, no, we need the video? Or is it generally a conversation of look, okay you could have the video, but here&#8217;s the reason why I think for the planet, you shouldn&#8217;t have the video. How does that conversation normally go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We advise them. It&#8217;s like with banners, with sliders, we advise them. I emailed something to a client last week saying, here&#8217;s the Google stats. About 8% will see banner number two. Do you really think banner number three, as one of your key important messages being viewed by 4% of your home paved visitors, you&#8217;re better off putting that content on the page. It is the client&#8217;s choice in the end, but I will educate them so they&#8217;re conscious of the choice that they&#8217;re making. Rather than not aware and then complain that nobody clicks through from banner number three. And I&#8217;m like, well, we did tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s some things I don&#8217;t give clients a choice on, like accessibility. They don&#8217;t get a choice about having an accessible website because you don&#8217;t want to give people a choice where you don&#8217;t want them to make a poor decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And in terms of your agency, do you advertise your environmental credentials?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We don&#8217;t really talk about it at the moment, but we will be dipping our toe in the water and talking more and more about it over the next few months, because we&#8217;ve been doing some interesting stuff in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that an autoplay video, that seems like the most extreme example. You know, you go to a website, suddenly you&#8217;ve downloaded without your realizing it, I don&#8217;t know, 10 megabytes of data that you really didn&#8217;t need. Just run through the components of a typical webpage. So what have we got? We&#8217;ve got text, we&#8217;ve got images, we&#8217;ve got video, we&#8217;ve got, audio like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are quick wins? What&#8217;s the order, if you like, that you should go through when in your head you&#8217;re trying to make a page more environmentally friendly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:49] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I would start with images because a website typically has more images than videos. And if you&#8217;re doing something with images like you are, I don&#8217;t know, using a CDN, or you&#8217;ve installed the performance plugin and you are delivering things as WebP, then one plugin and one solution might work across all images on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would definitely think about images in terms of making sure you deliver the right sized image for the device as well. So make sure that in your theme, you&#8217;ve got that function which saves it all out at the various different break points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you&#8217;re on a, mobile website, the image that&#8217;s loaded should be the same size as the device that you&#8217;re looking at. Not a great big image that&#8217;s been squished down, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:30] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Exactly. And that can be a bit tricky because sometimes on mobile sites for example, we&#8217;ll have a nice banner image, but we&#8217;ll make it cropped and square. Whereas on a desktop site you might have it that letter box shape. And actually it won&#8217;t really work on a mobile. It&#8217;s too sort of narrow and thin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you sometimes need to be a bit careful about, especially with the block editor, do you need to have different versions of images unless the cropping is right in the middle. Doesn&#8217;t work very well with the block editor to just auto crop. It&#8217;s about thinking about it. So I definitely start with images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little things like making sure you are using SVGs where it&#8217;s appropriate. If you&#8217;ve got an animated gif, turn it into a video. I then look at the videos. Just make sure you&#8217;ve got facades or posters on videos and try and persuade your client not to have that large banner video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would then look at fonts and make sure all your fonts are self-hosted. Which is a good thing anyway because certainly from a GDPR perspective, if you are using Google fonts in Europe, then there&#8217;s been some case law around, it&#8217;s leaking data to Google about who&#8217;s using those fonts and you don&#8217;t want to be doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that again will speed it up because you can cache the fonts and things like that. And subset the fonts. So I think you can do things where if you are only, if you&#8217;ve got a font set that&#8217;s in multiple languages, but actually your website&#8217;s just in English, only use the bit of the font that you need for the language that you are working in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I would definitely think about things, other things on the website, like email. If you&#8217;ve got a transactional site and you are sending out lots of confirmation of shipping emails. Do you need a really big logo in the email? Can it be a tiny logo or even just text on a colored background and make those emails have a lower carbon footprint as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How does WordPress out of the box do with helping you get to some of these targets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It&#8217;s not helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I was going to say, I imagine that most people listening to this podcast have an understanding of everything that you just said, but the typical user of WordPress is not somebody that&#8217;s listening this podcast. Used by millions of people who probably see the media library throwing the biggest image they&#8217;ve got, and that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:43] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I think you&#8217;ve got to be a responsible theme author. As an agency, we build our own custom themes for each client. So we&#8217;re not constrained in any way at the design stage. But if you&#8217;re choosing either a free theme or a paid for theme, you can be quite wise about it. So if you are you&#8217;re building a brochure site for a client, you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme with every possible e-commerce, form plugin, event plugin, all that extra code. If you&#8217;re not using font awesome icons, then don&#8217;t let the theme pull in the complete font awesome icon set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just download a little SVG. So try and think about the theme that you choose. It can be a bit of a pain to actually turn off on some of those very flexible all singing, all dancing dancing themes, the options when you just want something really simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some plugins that can help. So for example, we often use a plugin called Perf Matters, which is really good for performance. And one of the things I particularly like about that plugin is, so if we are working with a client where they might have an inquiry form or a landing page with an inquiry form on it. You install a plugin, we use Gravity Forms. Really brilliant plugin. Love it. But of course you get that plugin code in the head of every page, just in case the form&#8217;s required. Well turn it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use Perf Matters and go in, and go I only want the Gravity Form code to be embedded on these three pages, on the site that have forms on. Doesn&#8217;t need to be downloaded for any other pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same with something like Google Maps, the API for Google Maps. Often you&#8217;ll put it in so that you can have a nice map on your contact page. Well actually, number one, could you replace that map with an image, and then just link out to Google Maps? How many people are actually going to be scrolling in and out on the page?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it from the user&#8217;s perspective, but then actually just have that Google Maps API code in the contact page. Don&#8217;t have it anywhere else on your website. It&#8217;s just not needed. But you see it a lot where all the plugins inject all their stuff into the head on every single page just in case. So go through and turn things off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned earlier that obviously this is something you&#8217;re trying to embed in your company. You also mentioned that you don&#8217;t have the conversation about accessibility. It&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:10] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, we talk about it. The only time we really push back is where clients have got brand colors, which aren&#8217;t AA accessible, and then we discuss with them whether we can change them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But are you going to in the future be having more conversations like this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong>And if so, how forceful are you going to be with your clients if they push back? Say, no, no, no, no. There&#8217;s a delicate line here, isn&#8217;t there? You want to do the best for your client and the best for your client may be a bitter pill for them to swallow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:39] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> There may be a really good a brand reason, depending on the client, as to why they have to use a particular font. But I would be going to the client and saying, I&#8217;m going to tell you why it&#8217;s not a good idea. In the end, it is your choice. It is your website. You own the site once you&#8217;ve paid me for us to build it. So it is yours to do what you want with. But do it consciously, knowing the consequences of the decision that you are making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will always tell them, in the end it is their choice. But with things like brand and fonts and that, well you know, the consequences of pulling in an Adobe font is 6 to 800 milliseconds of a page load. That can be the difference between a first and second spot on google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So sometimes you can argue it really strongly from a commercial reason, and they will listen and go, right, let&#8217;s go back to our brand designer and get them to find some web fonts or some Google fonts that we can use. And elsewhere, yes, you&#8217;ll use that fancy type kit or whatever font, but let&#8217;s use something for the web that actually will work and not impact on the performance of the site. Because if they&#8217;re a commercial client, they&#8217;re going to care about the performance. We need to make them look good to their boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given exactly what you just said, is there some accreditation that websites can expose to the world to say, we made an effort here? I&#8217;m trying to think of an example, but there are badges that you can get in all manner of industries to say, okay, we went through this training. We made the effort here, and so we have a badge to prove that we made an effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there something that people can do on the internet to say, look, our website is consuming 50%, 30%, whatever, less energy than it might have done. We made an effort. Here&#8217;s our badge to prove it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I&#8217;m not aware of a badge, but there are lots of people doing lots of things out there. So there might be. I think it&#8217;s really hard because what might be a good score for a e-commerce site, might be of a poor score for a different type of site. And I think that in the end, yes, you can measure against other people, but actually you have to have that intrinsic motivation for just wanting to do it. It&#8217;s not about collecting badges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it matter if your site is AA accessible and you have a badge on your site? Or does it matter that you basically have enabled 40% of the population with disabilities or temporary impairments to actually access your goods and services, and you&#8217;ll increase your profits as a result?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that was the website piece. You know, can you expose this credential to visitors? What about you as an agency? Can you expose your credentials to your clients? Is there anything there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:26] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, we&#8217;re working, and it is a very much a work in progress, towards something called B Corp, which is an accreditation thing that you can get for being, if you like, a good citizen to the planet. It covers environmental. It also covers governance, and more things to help with inclusivity and diversity. And we are rewriting our staff handbook, and we&#8217;re measuring our carbon footprint as part of that, as an agency. But we&#8217;re also doing other things as well. Making sure that we do things in a way that&#8217;s consciously responsible, and there&#8217;s got to be a business for good. We want to be a good citizen for the planet. And I think that&#8217;s quite a high standard. And there&#8217;s, I think about a thousand companies in the UK who have that. And we are not there yet, but it&#8217;s something that I think we can aspire to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have any sense that this message that you are preaching here is beginning to catch on? You are definitely in the vanguard. Most people are not talking about this. If we go downstairs, we&#8217;re not really picking up on that message yet. But do you sense some kind of change? Are you communicating with people on a more regular basis about this? Clearly you are interested in it, but are you talking into the void or are people beginning to listen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of people in communities where the communities are talking about this a lot. I think what&#8217;s really nice is I was given the opportunity to speak at a conference, and this conference, to the entire WebPress community had a session about digital sustainability. I personally think that every conference that anyone puts on should have at least one speaker, or channel, or workshop, or something talking about sustainability in the industry, or sector that the conference is in. Because it is looming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legislation is coming. The governments are legislating now, and at the moment in the UK it&#8217;s only very, very large businesses who have to do reporting. But if you are a large business wanting a government contract with a value of more than 5 million pounds, which you know, even small consultants and agencies can go for big contracts. You have to have your scope one, scope two, and some scope three emissions and a carbon reduction plan will be coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2028 The National Health Service in the UK will require every product or service that is supplied to it to have a carbon footprint. So you need to be starting now because for some things that&#8217;s going to be really hard to do and it&#8217;s going to take a while to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So start now with the little things, the quick wins. Start measuring where you are, because your carbon reduction plan has to say how you&#8217;re going to reduce. And then you have to show that you are making those reductions. So start measuring now, so that all the things you start doing now can be part of that reduction that you make and you can report on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are describing things in the UK. In the UK in the future, you are literally going to be unable to get certain types of website client work if you cannot prove that you&#8217;ve done the due diligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting. But still a way off. We&#8217;re still five years out from that portcullis closing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:37] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah. But if you are a large business, very large business, you already have to do mandatory reporting. The government is slowly going to bring that down. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me in the slightest if by 2030, as well as putting in my annual tax return, on my submission of my company accounts to Companies House, I have to do a carbon accounting report. Every small business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU, 23 million organizations there are in the EU at the moment, by 2028, all of them are going to be expected to put in some sort of carbon report on what they&#8217;re doing. The legislation is coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even quicker than that, procurement is starting to change. So I think it was the back end of 2021, Tesco sent out a letter to all of their suppliers saying, we want you to do these four things. You need to have a carbon reduction plan. You need to move to green energy. Otherwise you can&#8217;t be part of a supplier to Tesco. Doesn&#8217;t matter whether or not you are a large business or a small business, they sent it out as part of their procurement. So the government legislation is coming, but larger businesses are doing it quicker because they&#8217;re using procurement as a tool to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on top of that, for some organizations now it&#8217;s affecting their access to finance. So if I&#8217;m a pension fund or I want to invest in a large enterprise or a business, why would I invest in you, if you are not sustainable in 5, 10, 15 years time? They are now beginning to ask for those carbon reduction plans, sustainability report. What are you doing for your ESG as a condition of investment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the window of opportunity for ignoring this is fast closing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:25] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> And why not get ahead of it? Why not be that agency that can help your clients with these challenges?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Although you described that there&#8217;s no badge necessarily for this. It really does feel that for the right client this is a conversation which will win you work. If you can prove that you are going to do this work now, like you said, who&#8217;s going to say no to a more green website? Would you like your website to be much more environmentally friendly than it could have been? Well, no, actually we&#8217;d like it to pollute more, please. That&#8217;s just not a conversation you&#8217;re going to get into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:56] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Exactly. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting. So the only piece that I can see in this conference where anything is mentioned about the environment is hosting. And even that, it&#8217;s probably I don&#8217;t know, one in fifty, one in a hundred who have that badge. Talk to us about that side. So obviously we build websites, we&#8217;ve got a computer, we know that it&#8217;s stored somewhere, but tell us about hosting, and what people are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:22] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Actually some of the hosting companies here are very green, but you have to consider the political climate. So if you are a hosting company based in Texas, in the US. And you are being told that you have to support big oil because that&#8217;s what runs Texas. You don&#8217;t talk about the fact that you are running your hosting data centers on green energy. So it&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re not. It&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s not necessarily part of their marketing message at this point, because the political climate isn&#8217;t necessarily conducive to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are saying that the hosting industry broadly are doing a fairly good job of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:00] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, some of them are, yeah. I know for a fact a lot of the Google Cloud hosting is green and a lot of the big, they&#8217;re using Google data centers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That feels like one of the most grounded things that you can do. If you&#8217;re having a website, you can actually go out and look for green hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:16] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> And the Green Software Foundation has a little URL. It&#8217;s a little tool. You can literally go and put in your domain name and it will tell you whether it&#8217;s running on a green hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What is the Green Software Foundation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:27] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> It&#8217;s a sort of organization that is talking about green software, green web, green all sorts of things. They&#8217;re doing some really interesting stuff. They work a lot with very large organizations. I think to be a member you have, like have to pay up 10,000 pounds or something. It&#8217;s like out of my league to be a member, but it doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t see what they&#8217;re doing and listen to what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve also got a really interesting free course that you can do on sustainable software development. And it gives you all the background and all the things you should be considering when you&#8217;re building software and websites basically, and the things that you can do to make them run better in a greener way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If I wanted to make my website more SEOable, I&#8217;ve got a whole suite of tools available to me. And many of them will give me some sort of data saying, okay, this page is, you&#8217;ve done a good job here. Like a traffic light or something you, you know what I&#8217;m saying? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:25] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are there tools similar to that, that we can use in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s some kind of extension to a browser where we can see what our browsing is doing on the internet. In other words, is there a plugin, something which will show us a dashboard saying, okay this page, based upon the hosting that you&#8217;ve told us you&#8217;re using is consuming or creating this much carbon debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:51] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> There&#8217;s individual tools at the moment that I am aware of. You can put in a URL and it will say, oh yes, your page is this many grams of CO2. Actually what we&#8217;ve done is something. We&#8217;ve been doing a thing. I did that thing of having a side project to the agency, and we&#8217;ve been building something for the past couple of years, and we&#8217;re about to launch a piece of software. It&#8217;s an extension to WordPress, which will actually, in the dashboard, show you a daily carbon footprint of your website based on daily visits and page views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How is that working then? So presumably the daily page bit is fairly straightforward. This website has been consumed 25,000 times, we can make the connection there. But presumably it must be figuring out, okay, that page had a video on it. This one had nothing but text, and it&#8217;s based upon upon some hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:40] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> So we&#8217;re basically measuring the page, a measure of the data or page weight for each page. And then we&#8217;re looking at the visitors to the pages as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And are you giving like a score out at the end?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:52] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We&#8217;re not giving a score at the moment, but eventually when the software&#8217;s launched and there&#8217;s lots of people using it, we will be able to say, oh, actually, in comparison to other people using our software, you are in the top quarter, or bottom quartile or you are in the middle. So we can give some feedback. But more importantly, if you look at it and you use things like traffic, then you can start to see where you should be optimizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. And is this tool going to give you helpful advice on how to optimize it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:22] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yes, we&#8217;re building out a knowledge base as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I was going to say, it&#8217;s all very well saying this page is doing really badly, but, you know, tough luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:27] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, where will it point me? What are the sort of metrics that you&#8217;re going to be helping me with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:31] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We&#8217;ll be helping with all the basics. It&#8217;s actually about empowering the content editors. Because as website theme builders and as website developers and designers, we can build the most amazing AA accessible website that&#8217;s really lightweight and fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a year later we could audit it and find, oh, content editors added, you know, 30 images and they didn&#8217;t realize they had to add alt text to each one. And they can have loaded that really large video and not realized that it needed a poster attribute to make sure that the page didn&#8217;t take a long time to load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we are trying to do is give that feedback to editors in the browser when they&#8217;re editing the site, in the backend of the admin. Because that continuous measurement, if they see a little spike, or they see that suddenly something&#8217;s changed, they can go in and fix it. Rather than end up just doing an annual check, or checking every so often and ending up with a list of defects to fix, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the whole point is, it&#8217;s about designing out people making those unconscious mistakes in the first place. And making sure the website continues to be at the standard it should be at and potentially improves over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So slightly off piste a little bit. That&#8217;s lovely. I mean I would hope to be able to see that kind of data and it would be really useful to me as a website builder. What about by just general browsing the internet? Do you know if there&#8217;s any tool which can tell me, right at the end of today Nathan, you&#8217;ve been a poor citizen. Some kind of, I don&#8217;t know, a browser extension or something which tells me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:05] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I don&#8217;t know that. Nobody&#8217;s ever asked me that question, so I will have to take that away Nathan and I will have to come back to you, because I genuinely don&#8217;t know the answer to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that would be quite a useful thing to know. At the end of the year, Nathan, your internet use is the equivalent of a 20,000 mile flight or something that would be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:22] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> You must be online a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I really am. Yeah. Okay, when are you hoping to get this tool out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:28] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> We are doing a soft launch, early adopter, by invitation to Indigo Tree clients mid-July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So really soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:35] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Yeah. And then from then on we&#8217;ll be building out new features and basically getting it to the point where we can launch it to people as a SaaS product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So going to go beyond WordPress at some point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:47] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Couldn&#8217;t possibly say, but yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Maybe. Maybe, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:50] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> Well, it depends on the roadmap and it depends what interest we get. And for me it&#8217;s not just about the commercial side of, we to build something that&#8217;s obviously profitable and successful. It&#8217;s actually where can we make the biggest impact? How can we, with what we are doing, make sure that we get the biggest carbon reduction overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the great thing about when you&#8217;re measuring stuff is we can actually report on global stats that are sort of, you know, a thousand clients and cumulatively this month they have reduced their carbon footprint by this amount. You know, so it is going to be an interesting journey to see how we get on and where the biggest impact can be whilst being commercial as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It really does sound interesting. Okay, so we&#8217;re going to have to wrap it up. We&#8217;re probably at the edge of the amount of time that we&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where would we go if we are curious about the things that you&#8217;ve talked about? So maybe that&#8217;s a link to your, the product that you&#8217;ve just mentioned. Maybe it&#8217;s just a more general set of resources. What are the two or three top places that you would send people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:45] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I&#8217;d definitely have a look at the Green Software Foundation. I would also go to, there&#8217;s a Slack channel in the WordPress. I think they&#8217;re just about to create a team in Core for sustainability. So I&#8217;d be going and talking to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I would be keeping an eye on people like Wholegrain Digital. Tom and Vineeta talk about things a lot. Tom&#8217;s got a really great newsletter that you can subscribe to. So there&#8217;s lots of people talking about it, but I think it&#8217;s about figuring out where it fits with your particular clients. And some of our clients are very values based and will immediately go for this. Some people just need that more commercial argument as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, Louise, thank you for telling us all about your efforts regarding sustainability and the environment. It is a genuinely fascinating subject, and my prediction is that this conversation is only going to get louder and louder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:39] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> I hope so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> As the years go on. Yeah, thank you for talking to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:41] <strong>Louise Towler:</strong> You&#8217;re welcome. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisetowler/\">Louise Towler</a>. She joined me at the recent WordCamp Europe in Athens to talk about websites and making them more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise is the founder of <a href=\"https://indigotree.co.uk/\">Indigo Tree</a>, a UK based agency with deep expertise in WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She gave a presentation at WordCamp Europe entitled, Digital sustainability: The benefits for business and the environment in which she emphasised the impact websites can have on our planet. Her aim was to deliver practical tips for users and developers to help them make informed decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This presentation is the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, and we cover quite a lot of ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise highlights the significant role which electricity plays in powering data centres and transmitting data to end devices. Even if data centres use renewable energy, there is still a need to address overall electricity consumption. She points out that the internet is the fourth largest polluter globally, surpassing the airline industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss how the continuous and widespread use of the internet has made it difficult to reduce its own impact, whilst still emphasising the importance of the steps we can take to make the internet more energy-efficient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests ways that we can all make a difference right away; educating clients about the consequences of certain design choices, such as using large videos or autoplay features that require substantial data to load. Optimising videos, images, and other website elements, which makes it possible to reduce data consumption <em>and</em> improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then explores other suggestions such as using modern image formats, using images as placeholders for videos, self-hosted fonts, and considering the carbon footprint of email communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise acknowledges the challenges of discussing environmental concerns with clients whilst also explaining that we have to come up with ways to make clients understand that these decisions are beneficial to them as well. After all, an optimised website is one that is looked upon favourably by search engines. Whilst clients ultimately are the decision makers, informing them about the consequences of their choices can help them be more informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving onto WordPress, we talk about the responsibility theme authors play. It’s a crucial role, helping users make sustainable choices. Her agency builds custom themes for clients, which allows them to have full control over design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the subject of how legislation is certainly coming, and so getting in early and understanding the implications of such legislation will help your own endeavours in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast we chat about some of the tools which you can use to assess the impact that your websites have, including a tool which Louise and her team have been working on for the last few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in how your sites can become more sustainable, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/session/digital-sustainability-the-benefits-for-business-and-the-environment/\">Louise WordCamp Europe presentation &#8211; Digital sustainability: The benefits for business and the environment</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indigotree.co.uk/\">Indigo Tree website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://perfmatters.io/\">Perf Matters plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\">Gravity Forms website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/\">Green Software Foundation website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C03JNV77Y57\">Sustainability Slack Channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wholegraindigital.com/\">Wholegrain Digital website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: What the Client Thinks They Know\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=75453\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/what-the-client-thinks-they-know/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:385:\"<p>Clients consider they have learned a lot through GPT or by Googling it.

The camp was scheduled for August 5, and organizers had already secured a venue and progressed on moving the camp forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team <a href=\"https://dhaka.wordcamp.org/2023/\">published a statement</a> on the event&#8217;s website, which cited the interference of corporate interests: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The WordPress Community Team’s primary goal is to support and nurture the WordPress community by enabling organizers to create amazing events that celebrate WordPress, its community, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/\">globally shared values</a>. The Community team cannot support the event if a WordCamp is not aligned with these values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#the-five-good-faith-rules\">WordPress events benefit the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals</a>. The Community Team expects that WordCamps decisions should be guided by the community’s collective wisdom and not influenced by any one company’s interests. When companies attempt to exert influence on the planning process, the Community Team must step in to mediate. In this instance, we have decided to cancel WordCamp Dhaka 2023.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team urged the Dhaka community to focus on collaborative organization, companies uplifting the community, and greater diversity in participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an equally vague <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/07/03/incident-report-recent-cancelation-of-a-wordcamp/\">incident report</a> on WordPress.org, which doesn&#8217;t even identify the WordCamp that was cancelled, Community Team contributor Sam Suresh called it &#8220;an unfortunate but necessary decision.&#8221; He summarized the team&#8217;s reasons for the decision:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The decision to cancel the event was not a result of inadequate planning or insufficient effort on the part of the organizing team. Instead, there were observable actions from local community members to influence decisions that would benefit specific individuals or companies. When this influence did not immediately lead to their desired results, the individuals aimed to undermine the organizing process and event success. While the Community Team took steps to mediate, the inappropriate behavior and actions we saw necessitated the cancelation. This is a rare and extreme decision and underscores the severity of the situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Suresh said the issues applied to the local meetup group as well, and that all co-organizers and event organizers were removed from their roles and required to repeat their orientation to gain access again. A community deputy and a mentor were also removed from their roles in the project and the companies involved in the infractions were banned from sponsoring WordPress events for a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In times of challenges like these, it is important to remember that anyone can organize WordPress events regardless of who they work for and that WordPress community events are for the benefit of everyone, not any one business or individual,&#8221; Suresh said. &#8220;As a community, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/#our-expectations\">we will not tolerate harassment or influencing unacceptable behaviors</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after publishing, several community members commented with objections to the level of secrecy around the issues at hand and the people and companies involved. The Community Team&#8217;s nebulous posts on the matter seem to have further scandalized the situation, instead of offering clarity and transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This post definitely abides by the ongoing policy of not letting the community know who is being censured by the Community Services team, even in cases of egregious action,&#8221; WordPress marketing and meta contributor Sé Reed commented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve seen multiple cases of people filing harassment reports and various Code of Conduct violations, and that person/people have had various consequences, including being removed from organizing teams. However, those people then cite various reasons for leaving the team, often outright lying. But because of the secrecy around these cases, no one says otherwise and those people can and often do continue to operate in the community without any repercussions beyond secretly losing their &#8216;official&#8217; role(s).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reed highlighted the damaging effects of the secrecy surrounding these incidents, most notably that explaining the situation often falls to those who filed the report, as the Community Team abdicates any further responsibility after validating the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This action is damaging to the community as a whole, as we do not have a full picture of who we are working with and we continue to unknowingly support and empower people who have not honored their community commitments,&#8221; Reed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all participants in the discussion were in favor of The Community Team identifying the individuals involved, but in this situation they demand to know the companies that were banned from sponsoring WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m on the fence about knowing peoples’ names here, but I think people definitely need to know the <strong>companies</strong> involved; actively trying to sabotage a WordPress WordCamp is a serious breach of trust for the community,&#8221; WebDevStudios Director of Engineering Mitch Cantor said. &#8220;Especially when they may turn around and then make money from that said community they tried to sabotage.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealing with these types of sensitive situations is not an enviable task, but the community, for whom these decisions are designed to serve, is calling for a greater level of transparency regarding those who act in ways that are not aligned with WordPress&#8217; globally shared values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One way or the other, protecting folks who have violated the Community Code of Conduct is a policy that very clearly needs to be revisited,&#8221; Reed said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 19:11:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.3 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15340\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/wordpress-6-3-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5894:\"<p>WordPress 6.3 Beta 3 is ready for download and testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development.</strong> <strong>Please do not install, run, or test this version on production or mission-critical websites.</strong> Instead, it is recommended you evaluate Beta 3 on a test server and site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-3/\">6.3 release cycle</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-3/\">6.3-related posts</a> in the coming weeks for further details.

Last week <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/hackers-actively-exploiting-unpatched-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-ultimate-member-plugin\">WPScan reported that Ultimate Member had still not fully patched the vulnerability</a> after multiple inadequate attempts. There was evidence that it was being actively exploited in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working through the complexities of this security issue, WPScan researcher Marc Montpas opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58679#ticket\">ticket</a> on WordPress trac, identifying an issue with the meta key field in the usermeta table using accent insensitive collations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Looking at the latest string of vulnerability issues that came up related to the Ultimate Member plugin I discovered that the usermeta table has an accent insensitive collation for the <code>meta_key</code> field. This results in queries for <code>wp_cãpăbilitiës</code> to return the actual <code>wp_capabilities</code> row! See <code>update_metadata()</code> function in wp-includes/meta.php</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine the attack surface this brings. In fact, don&#8217;t imagine, just look at the recent attacks in the wild.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular issue made it more difficult to fully patch the vulnerability in question. Ultimate Member released version 2.6.7 on July 1, 2023, which whitelists for metakeys the plugin stores while sending forms. The plugin&#8217;s security advisory details a few other changes that may affect third-party developers:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>2.6.7 also separates form settings data and submitted data and operates them in 2 different variables. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[It] includes some significant changes to how forms submissions are handled. This may cause 3rd-party modifications to stop working. For Third-party developers, please update your customizations to support the new changes in the latest version</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimate Member recommends users review and delete any unknown administrator accounts, reset all user passwords including the admin, enable SSL and backups, and send any advisories to site members and/or customers about the incident. The plugin&#8217;s developers are working on releasing a feature inside the plugin that will enable the website admin to reset passwords for all users, but it is still being finalized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The reason for this is a site using our plugin may have been hacked or injected with malware that sniffs login inputs, because this vulnerability issue is prone to these attacks, we recommend to reset passwords after updating with a security patch. This is to ensure the best protection for your website user’s passwords.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>All Ultimate Member users should update to the latest available version, 2.6.7, which has the patch for the vulnerability. The plugin&#8217;s developers are awaiting more feedback from WPScan and are evaluating all their extensions to ensure they are secure. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 16:22:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 59: A Polyglot’s WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=15281\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/07/episode-59-a-polyglots-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30292:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy in the 59th episode of the WordPress Briefing.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intro music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have with me Alex Kirk, who is a longtime WordPress contributor and who has been instrumental in recent innovations in the Polyglots&#8217; work. Phase four of the Gutenberg project is native multilingual support, and so I see this work that is being done as instrumental, not only for our global community but in support of what&#8217;s to come in that specific roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado, Alex Kirk, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, how are you doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. Can you, let&#8217;s, because I bet that not a lot of people know who you are, can you first start by just telling me a bit about your work with WordPress, and then let us know what GlotPress is, for those of us who don&#8217;t know yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, Automattic sponsors me to work in the WordPress project on the Meta team and on the Polyglots team. So I spent time on improving or helping improve the software that powers the translation on WordPress.org. But I also work on the meta team on things like Matrix and evaluating if it would be a good fit for WordPress to switch to Matrix for their chat system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of really big projects that you work on, all of that kind of stuff that has no easy solutions anymore, is where you are right now. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no clear path, but it&#8217;s our mission to find it. So that&#8217;s part of what makes things interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So for folks who don&#8217;t know too much about the Polyglots team or generally translating WordPress, the software, can you let us know a bit about what GlotPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:02:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the translation system that powers WordPress.org is called GlotPress. It used to be a standalone software that was developed a couple of years ago, and it was transformed into a WordPress plugin at some point, and now powers the translation that happens on WordPress.org. So we translate WordPress core there from English to other languages, plugins, themes, block patterns, and it all happens through this software called GlotPress. There are a couple GlotPress installations around the world, but I think the WordPress.org one is one of the bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably, WordPress.org is pretty, pretty massive. Also, I think it&#8217;s great that you said that GlotPress was created a couple of years ago, like that, that indicates to me that you&#8217;re working on a really different timescale than a lot of folks are in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:03:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Alex, tell me a little bit about what it takes to ship translated WordPress software. So, I mean, for people who don&#8217;t need translated WordPress, like obviously we don&#8217;t have a good idea of what it takes to make sure that WordPress is available in so many languages. So what goes into the work of making sure that that happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so typically the WordPress software and plugins and themes are primarily created in English. And for it to be available in other languages, it needs to be translated. And for that to be able to happen, the programmers need to make the software translatable. Basically, they&#8217;re providing each English string for the translation software to be available to be transformed, so to speak, into another language and to what it&#8217;s being transformed to. This is what the translators do. So they go into the GlotPress software and see the list of texts that need to be translated and translate it to their language that they speak. Typically there is a process around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got people who have lots of experience in translation. And specifically in translating WordPress or WordPress plugins. And they&#8217;re kind of the, the people who help ensure good quality of translation. So anybody who&#8217;s working the WordPress project, so basically who has a WordPress.org account, can come in and address the translation. And that translation enters the system, so to speak, in a waiting state. And then somebody who we promoted to be a Translation Editor will come along and take a look at your translation and will approve it or will give you suggestions how to do the translation in a better way, or come up with maybe even a better translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, when you have like a small thing that&#8217;s just not right, like a missing full stop or something like that. They might just add it for you. And well, as soon as the plugin or software is translated to a certain level of translations those translations will be shipped out to the WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, for a plugin, you would reach 90% of translated strings. Those translations will then be basically packed up into zip file, a language pack and delivered to each WordPress so that you can have the translations available there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is 90% the threshold for plugins only, or is that also the threshold for like themes and the CMS itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well. We strive for 100%, I would say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. <em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:48]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, 90% more of a motivational point. To be actually honest, I&#8217;m not sure if the threshold is 90% for every project or even if it&#8217;s actually 90%. It&#8217;s different between different GlotPress installations and it&#8217;s basically something that is made as a setting that can be changed. There&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an arbitrary number. Typically you&#8217;d actually want to make sure that the most important strings are translated first. So the ones like, if you look at the whole picture, software usually consists of many parts, many of whom are not encountered by people on a regular basis. For example, error messages that could be like obscure error messages, and you could argue that those might be not as important. Or even sometimes you could even say like, do they need to be translated? Because if you encounter an error message and you search the internet, wouldn&#8217;t you probably want everybody to search for the English one to find the solution? But that set-aside, it&#8217;s important to have like the headline of the plugin or like the most important strings translated, and typically translating those most important strings will take you to a pretty high percentage so that we can then say it&#8217;s good enough to be shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha. I see, I see. Okay. Well, we talked a bit earlier about GlotPress&#8217;s timeline. It has been around for a bit, I know. But with that kind of in mind, have there been any notable changes to GlotPress recently?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think for GlotPress there&#8217;s been a bit of an up and down over time in terms of engagement and progress on the software. But in, in the recent year, I think we&#8217;ve added a couple of things that have been very helpful for translators. So one of them was adding the commenting functionality, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super helpful. Shocked it wasn&#8217;t there before. Sorry, translators. Sorry, all of our polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can be like there was when GlotPress was created there, there is like the, a big part of GlotPress are these states, like the waiting state when you enter translation, and then there&#8217;s approved state, which basically a translation we say it&#8217;s set to current, and there&#8217;s all sorts of process around it. So if the software is updated or translation might get fuzzy. But also like, if somebody submits a translation that doesn&#8217;t fully conform to what&#8217;s the translation editors, or like what the standards of the translation community have been set to, then you would have to need to reject it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that we felt wasn&#8217;t a very good and enticing way of telling people like, we appreciate your work. It wasn&#8217;t just quite right, but it&#8217;s more of a rejection. So this is how we came up with this like, let&#8217;s give people the option to say what was wrong and give them a chance to try again without making them feel rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Sort of a &#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221; as opposed to a, just refusal to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other things that we&#8217;ve worked on is, like, with the recent search of AI, like getting help from AI on translation and also on reviews. So, there&#8217;s some interesting things that you can do with AI in that regard; that one important aspect of translations, it&#8217;s also that we&#8217;ve got glossaries for each language where people, basically the translation community, identifies certain words they want to translate them the same way every time.&nbsp;And with the AI, you can basically add to the prompt, like, please translate those words to those translations when you give me a translation for that. And as it can change over time, you can always adapt this to the prompt, and that has been proven quite helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:09:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is great. That&#8217;s one of those things I know that AI has been like a really popular thing to talk about. And AI, specifically for translations, I think has caused some concern that maybe we&#8217;ll just like translate it all and hope that computers get it right when we know pretty certainly that computers don&#8217;t always get the translations right. But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, right? What you&#8217;re suggesting is that AI would suggest what could be translated and what it could be translated to, and then human beings have to confirm that that&#8217;s correct, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:09:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly it. So basically, we give suggestions to the translators, and then they can modify a translation before they press save. It&#8217;s more of a, like supporting them in getting the translations, like looking up words more quickly and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:10:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s wonderful. So is that the major sort of next step that is coming for GlotPress, or are there other things that we should keep an eye out for in that software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:10:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one direction that we&#8217;ve been taking GlotPress is basically making use of the fact that GlotPress is WordPress plugin now. And you know, typically, you would just use a GlotPress install. So on WordPress.Org, there&#8217;s like GlotPress installed, there&#8217;s translation projects created, something that we call &#8220;translation sets&#8221;. So for languages, you want to translate it to, it&#8217;s all pre-configured, and if you would install GlotPress to plugin on your own WordPress, it would be empty and not very useful. So what we&#8217;ve added is a way for you to basically be able to translate the plugins and themes that you&#8217;ve got installed in your WordPress into the language that you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might have a non-English website that you want to use certain plugins with, and they might not be fully translated at this point, so obviously, you could go to WordPress.org and help translate them, and that&#8217;s the way to, that&#8217;s preferred. But you could also now go install GlotPress on your own website and translate there. And then you have the translations there right when you enter them. And you can then contribute those translations back to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:11:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s with local GlotPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that we call local GlotPress. And you know, since we then have all these translations in the local database, it means we can do even more with those translations. So typically, language packs would be delivered to WordPress, but with local GlotPress, you&#8217;ve got like all the GlotPress software there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can do things like inline translation. So, on your own WordPress and wp-admin, for example, we can highlight all the strings that can be translated, and those strings just have to right-click them and enter your translation, and that way, you can basically go about and translate the whole ui, seeing your progress, as you&#8217;re making, basically turning the screen from red to green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:12:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s something now that you can do in your local WordPress installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:12:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s completely independent of WordPress.org. We would ask you to contribute the translations back when you have them, but being independent also allows you to translate like premium plugins, which could not be hosted on WordPress.org or doing something like that we call like hyper-local translation. So, for example, I speak Austrian German natively, but even inside Austria, we&#8217;ve got different dialects or like special words that we use. And if I wanted to create a website that&#8217;s targeted at the Viennese market, for example, I might want to use those specific terms. And this is something I would have to argue for those translations to be accepted on WordPress.org because it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s like a very targeted market. But if I have a local GlotPress, I can do those translations there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems awfully beneficial, especially as dialects. I&#8217;ve been having these conversations. I have, in my extended family, many children, and they are all learning languages and one of them has been having kind of thoughts about, like, dialects and how dialects are almost another language. And if so, like how do you know what everybody&#8217;s saying when you&#8217;re speaking all the same thing, but it&#8217;s kind of a little bit it sounds a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly a thing in the US, the distinct dialects across our country. And so I imagine that that&#8217;s gonna be a really beneficial sort of implementation for countries that have a lot of different regional variations and certainly smaller countries that have technically the same language as somebody else, but a lot of regional differences, regional specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:14:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same or different as the live translations, Translate Live, that we talked about at the WordCamp Europe a couple weeks back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:14:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, Translate Live is kind of the next step after local GlotPress. It&#8217;s like this happy marriage between the WordPress Playground and local GlotPress. So the WordPress Playground is also something that has come up a lot. It&#8217;s basically a way for you to run WordPress inside a browser window, so in JavaScript. And at first, it seems like mildly interesting, I would say. But when you combine it with other things like local GlotPress, it can lead to really interesting opportunities. So with inline translation, for example, on WordPress.org, you would typically find for every plugin, the UI would look the same. You would have a table of strings, and all that makes you realize you&#8217;re translating this certain plugin is that in the header of the page, it says this name of the plugin, but other than that, it can look really all the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, with WordPress Playground, you can put up a WordPress and run this plugin inside that Playground. And now, if you add local GlotPress to the picture, you can also do the inline translation of that plugin inside the WordPress Playground. So you&#8217;ve got inline translation. We add the glossary so they do make sure that you translate things the same way that they&#8217;re expected, and you don&#8217;t have to install the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, you can see what the translations will look like. You can see the strings next to each other, and what I think is most important, you will start with the strings that you see first, which are the most important ones. When you&#8217;re in the table view, those strings might be somewhere buried in the middle, and yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to see progress if you start with kind of obscure error messages, for example, versus just starting with the things that you see first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:16:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, moving translations away from table-based translations where you kind of have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. So the Translate Live, along with local GlotPress, along with WP Playground, is going to make it so that it&#8217;s easier to see visually what needs to be translated, where, what&#8217;s most valuable to translate for your mid users and your end users, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:16:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and also like for plug-in authors, it can be really good to see, you know, you can switch the languages in the Playground to another language, and you can quickly see like what&#8217;s the state of the translation in this language or in that language. And even things like, you know, Arabic as an RTL language rights to left language. The sidebar will change to the right, and you can also just switch language and see like, what&#8217;s my plugin like in this environment. I mean, this is not technically something that&#8217;s related to local GlotPress, but in this translation live ui, it&#8217;s very easy to change languages and see your plugin in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not specifically related to, to Translations Live, but also, I think that if we&#8217;re saying that WordPress not necessarily is going to lead the way with translations and native multilingual support in our CMS because, of course, it&#8217;s still a little bit far out on our roadmap. We certainly have an opportunity to have the best implementation of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if like that specific use case that you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t related directly to what it is that you are working on for Polyglots and inside GlotPress and all of that, I do see that having more streamlined, more easy to see and access opportunities to like test the way that our software looks across varying environments, especially those that change it substantially from what we typically work in day-to-day for any individual developer or any individual WordPress site implementer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:00</strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I think that that is a big step forward for all of us and certainly for anyone who is having to use WordPress as not a native English speaker. And so you say it&#8217;s not related, but it still is a big, a big benefit for WordPress overall, I think, to have this kind of work happening so that we can have those benefits to the folks who are using our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were a couple of different things that you mentioned over the course of our conversation. We&#8217;re gonna put some links to the show notes for all of those. But one thing that you mentioned that just kind of went by, and we never really had an opportunity to talk about it. You talked about the, I think it was GTEs, Global Translation Editors, the folks that are like approved as final approvers of translations. If there is someone who&#8217;s listening to this podcast who wants to become a GTE someday, where would they go to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the path to GTE is a PTE.&nbsp;<em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got different levels of translation editors. Basically, you start, you could say you start off as a translator, and this is how you can kind of show that you can do good translations or that you&#8217;re very firm in your language. And this might make you be noticed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re always looking for people who like to help with translations. And you might be then promoted to be a Project Translation Editor. Basically, it means that for a single language in a project, you&#8217;ll be able to approve translations. So, you&#8217;ll be the one who says, like, this translation is a good one and this conforms to the to the rules that we have stated as a translation community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further down the path then is the GTE, where you basically are allowed to approve translations across any project on translate.WordPress.org in your language. And that&#8217;s, usually you&#8217;ll be in, in that position with other GTEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, like, in each community, there is like, we&#8217;re people based. We talk about what might be a good translation. We talk to each other, try to find rules that maybe prevent common mistranslations, or set the standards for how we want the software to be translated. And this is something where you get a voice as a translator, but as a GTE, you get into a position where you can actually make the changes or find consensus on how the software should be translated in your language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if folks are not familiar where the Polyglots team works and meets, where would they find you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:41]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At make.WordPress.org/polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Alex, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intermission music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things. First, WP Campus 2023 is taking place July 12th through the 14th. That&#8217;s a nonprofit three-day conference with topics that focus on the growth of higher education, accessibility, WordPress, and anyone who works in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hybrid event. There is an in-person component on the beautiful campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I&#8217;ll add information about that in our show notes for anyone who would like to join in person or online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that the mentorship program pilot that I have been talking about a little bit over the last few months has been formally launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in contributing more to the project but not sure where to begin, take a look at this comprehensive onboarding experience. It&#8217;s cohort-based. It has some personalized one-to-one mentorship. There are guided courses, live workshops, all of that.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 6.1, WordPress 6.3 and that&#8217;s pretty much it. We have a full program alone with that. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for WordPress open source project sponsored by Automattic. And I&#8217;m so happy that Tammie Lister joins me today. She&#8217;s one of the Gutenberg design leads of phase one and design lead of WordPress 6.3 release squad and will be the editor tech co-lead on the all underrepresented gender squad for 6.4. In her day job Tammie works at the global agency Inpsyde from Germany as a developer. Good afternoon, Tammie. So happy to see you again. Thank you so much for making the time to be on the show. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I am great. Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, it&#8217;s so wonderful. And for our longtime listeners, you are no stranger. You&#8217;ve been on the Gutenberg Live Q&amp;A few years ago, and you were part of the last year&#8217;s developer hours, and it&#8217;s actually the first time that you&#8217;re on the podcast. How did that happen? For those of you listening for the first time, tell me a little bit about your WordPress work and what you&#8217;re doing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So my WordPress journey has been a long one and an awesome one. Like a lot of people, I started out by blogging and poking around themes and then I worked for a long time on the problems with themes, went via core through BuddyPress and then for a long time I worked as creating themes and working through that. And that&#8217;s where I started really my contribution journey through the theme review team and a little bit in core. And then Gutenberg, I guess it was my adventure by Gutenberg. The seed of Gutenberg is rooted in a lot of people from the theming background. It&#8217;s one of those not so hidden facts about Gutenberg, that a lot of people who worked on it had that background as well. And I&#8217;ve been really lucky since I worked on that project, to have quite an adventure working in various roles from design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the moment, I&#8217;m really lucky to be balancing back my developer skills. I&#8217;ve always done both, but at the moment I&#8217;m really focusing on how can I raise back up those skills, and I&#8217;m really lucky to be doing that in an agency role. So I am now getting to work with this amazing thing that we&#8217;ve created in the editor and getting to implement it within the agency at a development level so that I&#8217;m having all sorts of fun now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I can imagine that. That&#8217;s awesome. Well, thank you so much and yes, so you will have opinions about the extensibility of Gutenberg, which is one of the top…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Only a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That will come or that has been in the background or in the other current of all the new features, where&#8217;s the extensibility or how can we extend this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we dive into the recent releases, I want to tell you dear listeners all about the two live Q&amp;As that are coming up in July. So next week, we have on July 6, 2023 at 17:00 UTC and I&#8217;m not going to convert this to any other time right now. Time zones are the bane of my existence at the moment. So we have the topic, leveraging Gutenberg&#8217;s architecture to take plugin development to new levels, and we learn about how Gutenberg components and scripts can be used outside the block editor to revamp a plugins code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a case study of GiveWP 3.0, how that&#8217;s come about and we will have a guest, Jason Adams, who&#8217;s the director of development and Jon Waldstein, who&#8217;s the lead developer on the show. And my co-host will be Lena Morita who is a JavaScript developer on the components team. So she has some really geeky questions for the two and she&#8217;s quite excited about it, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it because I find it fascinating when developers discover all the ways to use existing components and script to build on top of Gutenberg. And it saves so much development time and it opens up new synergies between the core and the added functionality in a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re interested to dive in, the next one, two weeks later on July 21st, also at 17:00 UTC, we will hold the next live Q&amp;A with designers and developers of WordPress VIP, and they created a bridge plugin between Figma design themes and the theme JSON file for the classic and block themes. And it&#8217;s a fascinating way to keep faithful to the existing design systems and start spinning up new sites that mirror that design system without a whole lot of friction in between us. My co-host will be Joni Halabe from the web team at Georgetown University, also a very interesting live Q&amp;A. I&#8217;m really happy that we&#8217;re putting it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last one, you have to just subscribe to the newsletter so you get early access to it, newsletter at the Gutenberg Times and should you listen to this episode, I know a lot of people binge listen to it. If you listen to this episode after July 22nd, check out the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel for the recordings of that. We always record them, we have them transcribed, we have a post on the Gutenberg Times with the resources shared and all that. So even if you miss it, but the live Q&amp;A is really interesting because all of a sudden from the demos that are there, there comes these very quick questions from the audience and I really like having that a live show. So that&#8217;s that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are coming to the what&#8217;s released section and we come to what happened last night. So today, we are recording it on Thursday, June 28th and this morning in I think 1:30, WordPress 6.3 beta two was released. And were you up at that time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: No, I got up as far as about just hitting 11:00 UK time at night and I could see it wasn&#8217;t going to be the 11:00, so I left the amazing people that were doing and I&#8217;d kept going that far, and I bowed out and got some sleep because it was the second night running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there was a second shift coming in from Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Which is amazing. That&#8217;s part of the global project. We all get to open doors and close doors after each other, leave post-it notes virtually up for each other. There was a lot of that going on for the past two days and I think that&#8217;s the important thing. It&#8217;s been two days we&#8217;ve been working to get this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the make blog has one was the delay for one day and then also the explanation why it&#8217;s now called beta two instead of beta one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Systems are hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Systems are hard, releases are hard. I have switched my role for this release from doing for three releases, dev notes wrangling to actually be editor triage, co-lead with four other people. And this has been quite an interesting experience because all of a sudden, I&#8217;m looking behind the scenes and how timely a lot of PRs are to getting into the beta. And then it&#8217;s not only that there&#8217;s in the plugin, but you also need to sync the core data, the PHP code with the Gutenberg code and that is another big adventure for the tech leads. And you get to do this, when is it? In September before beta 6.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And I think you never know the unknowns until you know them and then you document, and then you try and that&#8217;s the important part of this amazing journey that is these big projects. You can predict most things but it&#8217;s always going to be the thing that you don&#8217;t predict. Honestly, we are doing incredible. Everyone is doing incredible. We just have to remember humans’ need to sleep sometimes and I think that is the beauty we learn. One of the amazing things we do now, which we didn&#8217;t do before is we have the use of the time zones. We use that. We have multiple leads. I think back even a few years ago, we didn&#8217;t have that for these roles and by having that, we can take advantage of time zones and lives and different people, but just documenting and writing, I think there&#8217;s going to be some like, &#8220;Okay, so that could happen.&#8221; Okay, now we document this, now we learn this and that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s stuff I now want to learn about. My curious brain is like, &#8220;Okay, well this went wrong. Okay, so how do we learn?&#8221; And that&#8217;s great because our documentation gets better. That&#8217;s generally what happens in between releases where people debrief and then take everything that happened in a release and then the next release gets better each time. We rise on the past release each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, yeah. As you know, this big project, nobody really knows everything. So the collaborative effort is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And if they claim to, I really think they need to go for a little walk in the countryside and think about themselves because nobody does and that&#8217;s amazing. You&#8217;ve just got to be very humble and just go, &#8220;Okay, on we go.&#8221; I just wanted to say shout out to everyone that was working so hard the past 48 hours and then some. You saw some beautiful handovers of patches, people just teleporting in on their phones and doing things and just some amazing open source hearts. You saw a lot of that going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I saw a lot of also the humbleness stuff. I don&#8217;t know, does somebody else is able to help me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I don&#8217;t know, but I might know someone who does in their mental Rolodex going through a list of people, and that&#8217;s amazing to do. It&#8217;s not like I might know, I&#8217;m going to struggle with it for a while and then I&#8217;m not going to come up with a good solution. That does not help anybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, no, no. At that moment, you need somebody who knows. But it&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie Lister: It would help otherwise you make it worse. It&#8217;s like the I will fix this and make it worse. Nobody needs that at 10:00 at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Not on a software that&#8217;s used by millions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: But a beta is a beta. And I think that&#8217;s the amazing thing we all have to&#8230; Now, let&#8217;s test it now let&#8217;s poke it and do things and nothing is ever going to be bug free. We always want that, but we do our best every time. I am so excited about how big this changelog is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;re getting to that. But I just wanted to do a shout-out for Brian Alexander who&#8217;s heading the test team. He has put together some amazing instructions on how you can make really impactful contributions to this open source project and we will share the link in the show notes. So when you go to the test <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/06/27/help-test-wordpress-6-3/\">make.webpress.org/test</a>, that&#8217;s the first post that will come up is help test WordPress 6.3. There are quite a few features coming in and they all need testing and they all need hitting the real life scenarios. Have plugins that use some of that, themes, just poke it from all the ends and it&#8217;s really necessary. And like every beta, it&#8217;s beta, but the bugs that we find now in the beta two, three and four, we don&#8217;t have to fix later when the release is done. So yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 16.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What also was released was Gutenberg 16.1 and that&#8217;s when 255 PRs merged with this release by 69 contributors and it&#8217;s just amazing what all went in there. It&#8217;s also understandable because if it went for the last minute, nothing really gets done in life, I found. And everybody wanted to get their work merged, so it will be in the next WordPress release and with the beta this week, it&#8217;s the last plugin release for enhancements and new features to come in. After that, it&#8217;s all bug fixing. So that made it for a mile long changelog. And Tammie and I will do our best to pick the stars amongst the 255, the bright shining stars and the highlights for you and talk them through. So do you want to hit us off with the first thing or do you have any other comments to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Wow, the amount. I guess the first one would be the navigation menu sidebar, the renaming, duplication, and deleting of navigation menus from browse mode sidebar. Navigation menu sidebar, the maturity of that in general, it feels such a long adventure the navigation menu has come on and I think that&#8217;s also maybe this point is why there was so much as well. It&#8217;s not the final-final release, it&#8217;s like Photoshop when you name a final-final 01 file or something, but it&#8217;s a closure and I think having a navigation block, having things changed, all these things, it&#8217;s a closure for a lot of these features. So I think navigation, it feels like quite a closure on some of these things as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it now made real sense. I think it really needed to gruel it and often and throw out concepts and get new ones there. So there&#8217;s navigation and then there is the sidebar menu in the site editor that also has a navigation piece to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: But bringing that functionality means that you then&#8230; There&#8217;s this weird separation, but it allows that to feel more cohesive and native. That&#8217;s the best words I can think of it. I think navigation&#8217;s going to take a little while to get a lot of people using because navigation&#8217;s over here and all these kinds of things. It&#8217;s that maturity of that feature and the dependability of that feature and the work there. I&#8217;ve definitely started feeling that it feels more robust to use with these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I finally feel the same way. I was always a little hesitant to touch the navigation because I knew it wasn&#8217;t finished. So I didn&#8217;t want…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: You sneeze near it, it&#8217;ll fall over, bless it. And I say that having worked on it myself, but it&#8217;s just a really hard problem. Turns out navigation&#8230; Linking alone is a hard problem, but navigation is linking plus plus plus. It&#8217;s a really difficult problem. If you just write code, it felt easier. But if soon as you add any interface, it&#8217;s really difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it&#8217;s also such a prominent piece of a website that you build, that it really needs to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And people are very bonded to a particular way of using navigation in WordPress as well. So we&#8217;ve got to retrain that mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that definitely is true. And so we have the navigation and the sidebar and the site editor as a navigation menu where you can do certain things and from that menu, from that sidebar, you already can rename, duplicate menus, or delete them. You cannot create them. That&#8217;s what you do when you create, you add a navigation block to a template part to the header or to the footer and then on the right hand sidebar on the white sidebar, that&#8217;s where you assemble your menu or the many menus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I like that consciousness of creating them somewhere else. There there&#8217;s so many opinions on separation and workflows. I feel like&#8230; This is a complete personal opinion, but making navigation too easy, I think that you end up with too many navigation everywhere. That&#8217;s always been one of our problems, that you end up with people drowning in menus. So I think that there&#8217;s a balance that there&#8217;s a maturity of navigation. I think that&#8217;s where the overlap of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And I like that in the site editor left side navigation, you just touch on the overall website, but you always go into the canvas to actually make changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The best words I can use is assembly there. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a good word, but it feels like assembly there, functionality doing here. And then that&#8217;s what it feels like. The different mental models that I&#8217;m moving in between when I&#8217;m doing things and I&#8217;m for that, different areas having very distinct different mental models when I&#8217;m doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I like that too because I can&#8217;t have two different thoughts in my head at the same time and be productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Life&#8217;s too short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So that&#8217;s why I like the next item, that the footnotes block is now coming to text blocks and that&#8217;s really something that we have all been waiting for a long time. And I know that Ella van Durpe has also tried multiple ways to get this done and I think she has such great ideas that she all pursued them all. And in the GitHub, you can have the history of all the footnotes, but I think this version is really hitting it out of the park. It works well. You put the cursor where you need the footnote, you get it from the menu from the inside menu bar menu dropdown on the block toolbar, and then you say footnote, and then it gets you right into the place where the content of the footnote, you can add that and it does the numbering itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you say, &#8220;Oh, I put a footnote in the middle of a paragraph, but also I need another one on top of it,&#8221; it recounts them so automatically. So that&#8217;s a really good feature. And it has color controls, but it also follows whatever your paragraph or your link color is. I just see that when you change the background of a paragraph, you get what you always get with links is if you change the text, you also need to change the link color. But that is something that&#8217;s the nature of the beast and there is no automation for that. But I&#8217;m really happy that this block comes and it will be in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Footnotes has an adventure for many years. I think footnotes is one of those, to me, it&#8217;s a sign of maturity for an editor. Quite a few see it as extra functionality or features. But it really is something that if you are in a particular field or you are particularly using, that you will not use an editor unless it has the footnotes functionality. It&#8217;s whether you choose to use or not. There&#8217;s no doubt whether you would want, you wouldn&#8217;t even have a plugin. It would be base functionality. So I think I am very glad to see it. Also, it&#8217;s a really strong indicator of things like collaboration. It sets that. It may not feel like it, but it is. It sets those using that canvas in a little bit of a different way as well. So I&#8217;m really pleased to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And that experimenting outside to then bring in, I think is a real good way forward to start seeing the interface as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And then you could actually move the footnotes block where all the footnotes are to the end of things or put them a little bit further. So it&#8217;s also quite versatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s really important depending on what article you&#8217;re writing as well. I do not claim to know any different medical whatever articles, but I&#8217;m sure that there are certain rules and regulations around where things go and depending on articles and what order things go. So having that functionality that you can determine yourself is better for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The next big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yep, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I feel like there&#8217;s a whole episode here on patterns and I guess the big one here is the naming and language to me is&#8230; Again, we talk about maturity, well renaming reusable blocks, rename to my patterns and add option to also add a non-synced pattern. This is big, it&#8217;s a small big thing I guess because it&#8217;s a big thing, but it&#8217;s not a massive feature, is it? But it also is a massive feature. Reusable blocks are quite limited but really quite bonded for some people. So I think that we got to respect that. But patterns to me are what everyone always wanted with reasonable blocks. When everyone describes what they want from a reusable block, it&#8217;s a mature functional pattern that has all the things that patterns are getting like syncing, all these things. And that&#8217;s what patterns are getting now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t know what you feel, but that to me it&#8217;s just maturity of patterns, you have blocks, patterns, template parts, templates. It makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, yeah. They&#8217;re pretty much cut from the same cloth and all had different names and also different models. So you had to get here for template parts, you need to go there for a reusable block and you had a pattern here, but they all had different updates kind of thing. So if you update a reusable block, it updates on all instances. A pattern doesn&#8217;t have any updates, so every time you put them into a canvas, they are all disintegrating. They don&#8217;t know about itself anymore. But what I like is that you now can create your own patterns and that is something that a lot of people were missing, that you were dependent on the pattern directory or you were dependent on the theme to provide your patterns or some third-party directory where you can copy paste it over, but you are not able to say, &#8220;Oh, this is a marvelous pattern. Can I store that on my site?&#8221; And now you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s the same interface or same workflow that you are accustomed to when you create a reusable block and there&#8217;s only one change there&#8230; Well, one attribute, it&#8217;s called sync this over all the instances, yes or no, it&#8217;s a toggle switch. So if you switch it on, you get a reusable block that if you change it, it changes all the instances. And if you switch it not on, it&#8217;s a pattern which does not update. But this is also, and you say, &#8220;Okay, but I want, when I change the style of my pattern, I want it to be replicated over all the instances.&#8221; It&#8217;s coming. This is the first step. This is the first step to unify the wording, unify the interface. And then also, you don&#8217;t have this duplicate mental model anymore. You find them and you can edit them at the same spaces. It&#8217;s called my custom patterns. That&#8217;s how you find them in the pattern list. And then in the block when you highlight them, there is manage your patterns. So it&#8217;s a great step and it&#8217;s one that we have been really all waiting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And putting my agency hat on, really trying to explain all this language. People, they work in design systems, they work in simple language and been able to sell this easier by simpler language that it behaves more like a design system as they expect. This all is that. You don&#8217;t have to then build a system on top because then the system will be easily done within, you don&#8217;t then have to bring the system. So I am very excited about this. It is the start. It is something that I would&#8217;ve liked a couple of years ago, but we had so much to do. We&#8217;ll get there. And I think that is the thing of there&#8217;s so much changing to do. Patterns are really getting strong. When they first came out, it felt like, &#8220;Oh, you can do patterns.&#8221; But they are so powerful. People get patterns way more than blocks as well. If you explain a block, people are like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to make blocks.&#8221; And I think we&#8217;re going to see less blocks people making and more patterns with this because patterns are just more useful then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what I have been seeing as well is also that people say, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t have to create a custom block just because I want a group of blocks in my site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: As much as I love block variations, I love all these things that you can do because blocks were amazing. I&#8217;d like to see less because then it means that patterns are doing what they&#8217;re meant to do because that&#8217;s what humans see. The interface that we&#8217;re having for pattern browsing and all that, we&#8217;re getting onto the management stuff that&#8217;s also part of this, that is just better as a human. Those human interfaces, once humans are using that, that&#8217;s way better than the tiny little pickers that we have for blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But I wanted to go back to what you said, while I would love to have it two years ago, but I think sometimes waiting helps you really to see the big picture, the whole picture. So two years ago, we didn&#8217;t have template parts, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Or we didn&#8217;t know yet how they&#8217;re going to fit in into the block themes and in pattern, we&#8217;re just at the beginning, but we didn&#8217;t know how to lock them. How to lock certain pieces of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: When I say that, that&#8217;s just eagerness and that&#8217;s also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, impatience. I see it, I want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Way too many people in the agency just want it tomorrow because honestly, those are the people who are trying to solve it with design systems who are trying to work around the problem today. Absolutely, these toys are amazing. And that then means these bigger systems can start using. They don&#8217;t have to build on top or around. They can build a lot more natively and the more native you can build, the easier upgrades, the easier components, everything. And it&#8217;s just a better experience for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Or you see the power now and you say, &#8220;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t it be great? And then you have to wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: If no one ever has to go through a load of patterns and I&#8217;ve actually had to do this, go through someone makes a change in patterns, but this was quite a while ago. If you use patterns and then you had to make a change in patterns at scale, that was hard to do before. Not having to do that, that&#8217;s going to be amazing. So getting all the amazing benefits of all these things, but having the amazing benefits of things like reusable blocks, but with these visual benefits that humans have. Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. We have all the toys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And there&#8217;s one more toy coming, which is now you can get a preview of block themes in your site. We all remember the customizer where you install a theme on your website and then you use the customizer and you were able to preview your site with the theme. And that hasn&#8217;t happened yet, but now it&#8217;s here for block themes as well. You see where you have all your themes, you see a live preview button and that gets you into a similar interface as the site editor. And then you can navigate your site with the theme that is installed but not activated yet. So you can see how your blocks behave, you see how your posts behave, and in advance you don&#8217;t have this what Helen Hou-Sandí always calls the save and pray feature there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: What you see might maybe what you get, but possibly not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Probably different, yes. And it&#8217;s amazing to see this in block themes. You also see all the style variations and how they would change your website and it&#8217;s really amazing. And it&#8217;s in 16.1 and it will come to 6.3 soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> And moving on to the site editor, the distraction free. We&#8217;ve had distraction free, so it&#8217;s like ta-da. But having that with the site editor, been able to create and just go get away. I remember&#8230; Age, that Dreamweaver full screen mode. And you now got that. The day where you could suddenly do visual in Dreamweaver, we&#8217;ve now got that in WordPress. Wow. It&#8217;s incredible to think that we can do that and you&#8217;ve got that without some of the ickiness. Bless it. Without tables. But we&#8217;ve now got that and that means that you can really focus on what you&#8217;re creating. And sometimes like if you&#8217;re doing some of these three-column query or whatever when you&#8217;re trying to do, you do not need those side panels and everything in the way. So distraction free is really, really nice to be able to do that and create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked earlier about modes when you&#8217;re doing things that really helps you with that creation mode, there&#8217;s a reason why when you are writing, you have those zen modes and that really works for people. Or you have that get away from my desktop all the apps. I don&#8217;t know what you feel, but I think this is just a small improvement to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Quality of life improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. And it&#8217;s a good one, when you can do an almost one-to-one preview of your site for that particular page, it opens up so much or it takes away so much worry. It&#8217;s really a better life there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Know what you&#8217;re getting rather than guessing what you&#8217;re getting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And test this, please test this so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And again, that&#8217;s the part of this. A lot of these things, they&#8217;re going in and they&#8217;ve been tested by the people that are creating them and they&#8217;re amazing humans, but they are not the people that are going to be poking it. It&#8217;s now up to people that are listening to this, the people that are going to be testing, who are the people that should be poking it and using it. And I think that is exactly what this is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, absolutely. And what is now coming back to the site editor is editing templates as well as content. At the beginning of when the site editor was introduced, it was already there, but people got confused. Am I editing a page? Or they were not confused. They didn&#8217;t have that concept of a template part like this is just the template that drives all the pages and they made changes, and then were surprised that the changes were duplicated on all the pages. So it was taken out of the editor, and now it comes back with some guidance for the content creator of, &#8220;Okay, you can edit that now and when you&#8217;re in the template, you get all this whole title kind of thing.&#8221; It names the things that are in there. And when you&#8217;re on a page, it gives you the page title exactly how you put it in and then you can edit it. But when you go into the places where the template is, it tells you this is a template piece, do you want to edit now? And then gets you out of the editing mode into a template editing mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that the guardrails there really help with the mental image as well. This is a template, I don&#8217;t want to screw that up. I just want this on my page. I want that content done. And you can do it in the site editor. Do you have to go back to the WP admin? Once in a while when you create pages, yes, yeah. But sometimes you want to edit things and you want to see it with&#8230; that&#8217;s the good part in this section now when you have the edit the page content as well as the template, is you see the page and it&#8217;s all in its context. How will it show up on the site? There is no, &#8220;Oh, okay. There is something on the sidebar that&#8217;s interfering with my page.&#8221; And it&#8217;s the same thing that we talked about before where as long as you see the full context of your page, all the worry goes away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I love what you said as well about having something in and then taking it away. I think that&#8217;s really, really important because sometimes when something&#8217;s completely new, it doesn&#8217;t work because it&#8217;s new, it&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s a bad idea and this is showing, it just needed to be delivered in a certain way. And I think not everything, but quite a few things that have been added a little bit recently are that. They are re-adding a slightly different variation once we&#8217;ve got things together. So sometimes you&#8217;ve got to find the combination of the puzzle to put these pieces in or the order to put them in. And this is exactly one of those, it needed to come in a certain order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I had some interesting conversations at WordCamp Europe. I had a lot of conversations at WordCamp Europe, but some of them were really interesting because I think if you&#8217;re not a developer, it&#8217;s really hard to understand that you have a vision for what people want to do. But unless you start programming and putting it in, you don&#8217;t know yet how it&#8217;s going, how it&#8217;s going to work. So let&#8217;s put it with the features in and then see what other people think about it and then reiterate on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s part of the freedom of creating in the open and part of what we&#8217;ve learned with this whole project is by creating in a plugin, we get to experiment. I want to use the word play because experiment sometimes feels a little bit harsh, it feels serious, but we get to play and see if this goes here, what did someone feel about it? This goes here. Testing things was really, really hard to do in core and it has been really, really hard. But by having it in this and been able to backtrack quicker, and that has been something that has happened time and time again of, &#8220;Oops, nope, let&#8217;s try this.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Okay, well this idea didn&#8217;t work this time.&#8221; We&#8217;ve still got it in the code base. It&#8217;s just back now. We haven&#8217;t completely lost it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In core, ideas go and get lost because it&#8217;s a big space, sadly. So having that flexibility, I think we are doing it a lot more as a project and having that healthier macro experimentation. But it&#8217;s seeing those mature ideas come. I love seeing things that was talked about, like you said footnotes, but things that were said years and years ago and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yay, they finally shipped.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it&#8217;s not because they couldn&#8217;t ship it earlier. It&#8217;s also you didn&#8217;t know yet how other pieces that needed to fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s like baking a cake. It needs to be the right time and the right ingredients need to be available, and the right people to taste the cake. I don&#8217;t know, that metaphor went really weird, but right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, only chocolate lovers love chocolate cake, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And sometimes you are not delivering chocolate cake, you are delivering a Victorian sponge and to the wrong crowd. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those metaphors are really…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s not working. Backtrack, what&#8217;s the next thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Let&#8217;s try it again. We all have experiences, but it&#8217;s not in WordPress. So creating something really, really new in WordPress with a lot of backwards compatibility promises, it&#8217;s really hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I always describe it as the difference between moving a little rowing boat to moving an ocean liner. One of them big Disney cruises or these giant things and then moving a little rowing boat. It is really easy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s not the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. But this editing piece, I think it&#8217;s really so much better now and I think it meets the vision now. So what&#8217;s also in the site editor bar is some template details. You might have already seen that, but now it also respects the settings and there is some language going on as well. Some language changes. You see the home template details, but that only tells you, okay, how many blog posts are on it? So it&#8217;s the blog home and not only just the homepage. So if you switch it to a static page, you will see that in the pages and not in the template pages. But it&#8217;s really good to have those template details in the site editor on the sidebar, it gives you a little bit more context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: With components, I guess one of them to call out is the button has a size prop, which is a small little thing, but it&#8217;s maturity of the burn block, how many sites have burned every one of them? And having something like that is really big. It&#8217;s going back to one of my favorite topics of design systems. If we are building off core as a basis, you need to have these foundational things as part of it. So I&#8217;m really excited to see. Anytime I see that or any of the blocks getting different attributes, I am giddy with excitement about all those things. Basically because it means I can then use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You can use them, you can create styles with them. You can have different variations on the buttons and you don&#8217;t have to create a new block for the buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Another block that got some nice features, an additional feature in there is the list block. It now has a different numbering type for the ordered list. So you could have alphabetical numbering or numbered numbering or Roman lit numbering and then capitals and then small cases. So now you have quite some options in there. I really like that. It&#8217;s catching up with other documentation or writing tools where you have that. But yeah, it&#8217;s good to have it in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And image block has as aspect ratio control. For some reason, I wanted to say radio control. That was exciting. I think that&#8217;s a whole different thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Multimedia, an image has radio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Which again is maturity, right? You mentioned parity with tools. It is, right? We need to have the best of these tools so that people use them natively. So that&#8217;s really what a lot of this is maturity of these tools, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that was particularly important because you want your patterns when you switch out the images, you have them in a certain aspect ratio and when you switch them out and somebody puts in another image, you want it in the same aspect ratio and not blow up the whole pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Could ruin a party, that really can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m scrolling past it, but there is just stop to say that the interactivity API will not be in 6.3. It has been merged for the Gutenberg plugin, but it will only be available&#8230; they&#8217;re aiming for 6.4, which is not so far away, actually. September is the next beta. So it&#8217;s really going forward. There were some questions in the community about the interactivity API. A lot of people are very excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: We&#8217;re going to have some really nice toys for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And November 8th is I think the release of 6.4. So let&#8217;s get those toys wrapped up for Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s actually going to be some really interesting testing, I think. Some difference in testing because yes, we&#8217;ve done, but how you test some of that stuff is going to be a little bit different, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And we need a lot more examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going. How do you push some of that stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And definitely there&#8217;s some documentation. I think they started with the documentation now. There were quite a few insights already in the make blog on core. I think two of them, and I can certainly add them to the show notes. So people who are all interested in that and want to help with the rollout, definitely can get a headstart on it, but not in 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: The next one, I&#8217;m going past so much, this is such a long list. It&#8217;s amazing. It is in the design tool section and that&#8217;s a sticky position. That&#8217;s not a phrase. Try re-enabling non-root sticky position. So actually, I think any improvements to things like this is really nice. The fact that we have this shows maturity of design tools. So I think that&#8217;s part of calling this out. Design tools as a whole are a concept that is still relatively new to us, but design tools means again, that people are going to build using it. And so I&#8217;m really excited anytime that any of our refinement happens to any of our design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think in 6.2, the sticky position was already introduced for the header and the footer, but it was not for the sidebar because somehow it was really, really hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Sticky is hard. Sticky is hard to stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You never get it to stick. And it needed to be a root wrapper or root block to make it sticky. You couldn&#8217;t do it in a column block where you have a sidebar and make that sticky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Because CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Because of CSS, yes. Yeah. So there is another attempt to make this work and needs definitely testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yes, I was about to say that if anything needs testing, any time you see something listed in design tools, I would point anyone who is building themes or building anything to please test around those things because these are what really you will be building with. Having native sticky positions is much better than having to call on libraries or add things. And again, it means that people who want to build and create in the editor themselves have that capability to create some incredible, powerful, beautiful designs without having lack of access to them. It all sets us up to what amazing things could be done with the default themes, and that&#8217;s super exciting, what Christmas is going to bring there with all these tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the next one is actually for media and we need to set this up a bit. So when you copy paste something from Google or from another website and there&#8217;s images in there, when you paste them into your canvas, the image will always go back to the original. So when the original site goes away, especially when you migrate from one domain to the other, the image goes away. And now there was a little button on every image where you could say and if it was allowed from the source site, that you could add that image to your library with a button. But of course when you have 15 images, it&#8217;s a little harder to do that. So now in the pre-publish screen, there is a section that suggests that you upload the external images and gives you a button and you can do it all at once. You also can click on the images and see how they show up in the post or in the page. So I think that&#8217;s a great addition to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Just what people expect. Again, and I do not belittle it by saying that. It&#8217;s more just, it just raises it up. It&#8217;s what people expect, it&#8217;s what people want. So it&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It really raises the quality of the tools that you use, that it actually helps you also with the little things. Images are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Quality of life. Really, the release is quality of life and completion, which is a beautiful summer thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And refinement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. So I think we&#8217;re going to talk maybe a little bit later about the command section, but we&#8217;re into commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We&#8217;re good?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Going down the list, there&#8217;s two things about the commands and that is add commands to templates, template parts and styles, and to related commands as well. I don&#8217;t know if you want to talk about commands right now or later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: We could. So we have a name now for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: We do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In the development, it was always called the command center, but now it&#8217;s command palette and it tries to convey that&#8217;s the tool when you hit control K in the site editor, it gives you quick access to various commands, context-sensitive. And so you can say go to library or go to templates or go to template parts or delete template parts. All this you can do, and it&#8217;s also extensible. So you can create commands for your plugins, you can create commands for your themes as well. But the API is very, very new. So there are commands and with this release, there are commands with template, template parts, styles, how to manage the custom patterns, which custom patterns are the former reusable blocks. Sync patterns. So now you can say to your command palette, manage patterns or you also get UI commands for your post editor. So where you can say, add new post or something like that. So it&#8217;s not the center of it because it&#8217;s not a mission control palette or something like that. Or dashboard, it&#8217;s just you have a thought that you wanted…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: It&#8217;s your friendly helper there and there. And I think what these are doing is giving you examples. As you said, this is the start and it&#8217;s new. So by having these there, and this is just to start again, I think it&#8217;s worth of saying these are an example that someone could look at and be like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s how you write one,&#8221; as well. So I am super curious to do that myself and be like, &#8220;Oh, okay, that&#8217;s how you write one. Okay.&#8221; And I am really excited to see what people create with this. Now we have decided the name, I was going to call it Bob, but it didn&#8217;t catch on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I always call him Fred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I call everyone Bob. No idea. Everyone picks a name that they call things repetitively, I think. And now that it has a name, which is amazing. And I think one of the good things is its translatable. And I think that was key in all of it. Personally, as long as it&#8217;s translatable, as long as we agree to something, we get it in, things can change. But let&#8217;s get it in and iterate. So these are great examples to then copy, rehash, and learn from. So I think 6.4, we&#8217;ll probably see more. And then I imagine there&#8217;s going to be a flowy of plugins, some nice little iterations and people exploring what it means to have these things as well. So it&#8217;s going to be very exciting to see what people create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really happy about that. I would&#8217;ve never thought that my website tool would have these quick commands that I can just call up and then do stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So the way that I think of it is a combination of&#8230; Because initially, I was Alfred was where my mind went because it&#8217;s searchy, I think of it now like Alfred. And if this, then that, and those two things combined is where I go because it is that, but it&#8217;s also workflow. So it&#8217;s that but in WordPress for me, and I am very excited about extending that and then where people take it, because people always take it in a way that you would never expect it to go. So I think the next year or so, we&#8217;re going to see some really exciting things come from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I totally agree with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: New toys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: New toys for everybody when the biggest toy is probably creating those commands and find, &#8220;Yeah, oh I can do this. It&#8217;s not that hard.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And then even vigilant spaces to be able to create those commands ourselves. That becoming easier and easier I think is something that will happen over time as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I totally get it. I want to get into programming so much and lock myself away for two weeks and do all this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: You don&#8217;t have to lock yourself away for it, but that&#8217;s all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. I don&#8217;t see anything anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So much. And I think that&#8217;s the thing. If we are going through the bug fixes and the enhancements and there&#8217;s just so much, I like the repetitive word flaky because when I see the fix flaky, that means that all the things which flaky is a bug report for, it kind of works and it kind of didn&#8217;t. I love that we&#8217;re down to that end of polishing, is my reflection on that. So I think that is really, really exciting that there&#8217;s so much polishing here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think that was actually the outlook for 6.3, that most of the features get in and then we&#8217;re almost already…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: This is a giant section of those, which I love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Are we done? I think we&#8217;re done. Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There are a lot of documentation fixes. Code quality fixes, code quality in block library, code quality in site editor. No, this is cool. Yes. Tooling. Yeah, the whole testing thing was kind of, whoa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what you were talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: And I think that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s probably testing coming in for command as well, but it&#8217;s all maturity of that. As I&#8217;m scrolling down, I&#8217;m seeing improving, improving, improving, improving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. No, I think we made it. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress 6.3 Beta</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So we want to bring it back to the WordPress 6.3 beta and talk a little bit about what this means plus tickets for 6.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I think one of the big things to think about is yes, there are things in now, but things that are in are going to have to respond to feedback. So whilst you might think, &#8220;Oh, that burden is perfectly placed,&#8221; I am really paraphrasing here, &#8220;That burden might not be perfectly placed.&#8221; So during beaters, you might see that burden moves because that burden needs to be in a better place. And there are a couple of tickets out there at the moment, which one of them particularly has things could be done in a better way. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going with this. So we are going to see that. We are going to see, &#8220;Oh dear, this breaks this under this circumstance when we actually tested it under this load or we tested it under this situation.&#8221; Because you can test under all the situations you think, but you don&#8217;t have that until you are real world testing or you&#8217;re testing. And as the betas get towards the higher numbers, we&#8217;re on two now. So we&#8217;re probably going to go at least four I would say, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I agree, I agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I want to be optimistic. But realism kicks in here a little bit. You&#8217;re going to see fixes. So people need to bug report. People need to test or poke it, prod it, and use it. If you find something, see something, report something is the biggest thing because if you see something at release candidate, it&#8217;s a little bit late. It&#8217;s like shouting after the sheep have left the field. But if you say something now, it can be fixed. So if something doesn&#8217;t work with the plugin that is the only reason your client&#8217;s site works, now&#8217;s the reason to say basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And there will be. So I also wanted to caution some of the more eager WordPress news people or that want to grab screenshots and that kind of thing. There might be changes there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Going back to my button moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For instance, one change is from 6.0 to beta or to 16.2, so plugin releases 6.0 to 6.2, which will probably have some of the things that will get into 6.3 WordPress. But there was one menu item in the site editor on the bottom that was called library. And that has been renamed to patterns because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s in there. It&#8217;s the reusable block that are patterns now, template parts that are patterns now, and your custom patterns that are patterns now. And one was thinking about the library part for a long time because also there will be a fonts library, something like that. But then there were quite a few smart people who said, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m looking for fonts, I won&#8217;t go to library. I go to my styles and that&#8217;s a separate place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while we were using it, it was rethought what would make it a better idea or better metaphor for that. And pattern is something that&#8217;s WordPress branded and that a lot of people are really responding to. So library was not, it removes cognitive load when you have to think about, &#8220;I need to think of library.&#8221; When you see patterns, that&#8217;s where you want to go. So that&#8217;s just one example. There might be others. So when you do a screenshot for your video, make sure you have the latest beta or the latest…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Really, screenshots is release candidate as much as it feels late, it&#8217;s not. There&#8217;s several weeks and that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll find a lot of documentation takes it as well. I&#8217;ll working on the about page and we&#8217;re going to be doing the graphics around there as much as possible. But honestly, the final-final 01 PSD graphics&#8230; I don&#8217;t have to deal with PSDs, that&#8217;s when you take them because things rightly about translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This language though, I think so many of these language refinements happening, whether you agree with it or not, because language is so subjective and everyone has feelings about Bob or Fred, what things should be called, is a sign of maturity of the product, is that we&#8217;re working our own language system and we&#8217;re saying these things are called this because it makes sense in our ecosystem. So I welcome that we&#8217;re finally clarifying some language and not just confusing everybody because it&#8217;s always been very confusing. We&#8217;re finally settling on some terms and we are then documenting what they are called because one of the problems we&#8217;ve always done is called something and then not written it down. So actually doing that is really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Release candidate is scheduled for the 27th of July, so it&#8217;s another four weeks to go. So caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: So you got to let the dust settle, you got to let stuff go. If everything is amazing and unicorns walk and everything, then nothing will change, but something&#8217;s going to change because humans in software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s going to change. And computers, right? Computers are involved, all bets are off, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s okay, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: That&#8217;s totally okay. Just if you&#8217;re going on holiday, maybe have a friend do your screenshot for your blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So before we all come to an end, just a reminder, the two live Q&amp;As on July 6th and July 21st. Hit the registration button so we can all see you also on the live show and with some great demos. Before we end this show, do you have anything that you want to&#8230; How can people get in touch with you, Tammie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister</em>: I&#8217;m karma Toast on all the things and I&#8217;m still around core, I&#8217;m around everywhere and I would love to speak to people. I will be at WordCamp U.S. as well if someone else is going. So I&#8217;d love to say hi, but reaching out, I&#8217;m always welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome, awesome. Thank you so much for being on the show. And as always, dear listeners, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 85, and if you have questions or suggestions or news you want us to cover, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

Mika Epstein, who has served for the past decade, is stepping down, but not before<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2023/06/29/plugin-review-team-update-the-next-phase-begins/\"> launching a new crew of volunteers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is responsible for approving newly submitted plugins, maintaining the Plugin Reviewer Handbook, as well as investigating any reported security issues and guideline violations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the Plugin Review team has had very little turnover, but a new crop of six sponsored volunteers will be contributing an estimated 50+ hours per week. The new members include <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidperez/\">David Pérez</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eherman24/\">Evan Herman</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/frantorres/\">Francisco Torres</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lukecarbis/\">Luke Carbis</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/martatorre/\">Marta Torre</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/pacomarchante/\">Paco Marchante</a>. Their efforts are already in demand as they work to tackle a large backlog of plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given the nature of the work the team does, joining this team is a little different than some of the others: each new member will go through a vetting process by current team members before being selected,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;Some of the things the team is looking for are: a solid track record as a plugin developer; the ability to communicate clearly, kindly and constructively – both with other developers and users; interest in improving tools and processes; and excellent collaborative and conflict-management skills.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epstein is encouraging more volunteers to apply, if they have at least five hours per week to devote to the team, as they could still use more help. Prospective team members can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/apply/\">submit an application</a>, which will be evaluated by current team members. Applicants will be required to send examples of plugins they have coded to demonstrate their experience, provide references, and detail some of their contributions to the project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Jul 2023 02:52:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.3 Beta 2 • Help Test • WPDiversity • Plugin Team Next Phase • Mentorship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149753\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-3-beta-2-help-test-wpdiversity-plugin-team-next-phase-mentorship/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21962:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (June 26, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Release season is upon us as we approach WordPress 6.3&#8217;s August 8th release.

Now as a project manager and social media content manager living in North Carolina, USA, she uses the software in her work and  in disability-advocacy.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series shares inspiring stories of how people’s lives can change for the better through WordPress and its global community of contributors.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/fi-allison-dye.jpg?resize=1024%2C537&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison Dye\" class=\"wp-image-15292\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was first introduced to WordPress when she was 13 years old. Her parents gave her own WordPress website to use, play, test, and try whatever she wanted with it. Her health issues had started when she was eight years old, and being able to express who she was and learn new skills provided an escape she needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first encounter with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison said: &#8220;While the technical aspects of my new WordPress website intrigued me, I was more interested in the space it made for me to write. All throughout my childhood I had struggled with chronic pain, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms. Having a private world I could call my own, I was able to write my story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;There is something truly amazing about having a place to tell your story.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family faced many doctors, nurse, specialists and hospital visits, but could not get an answer to the difficulties faced by Allison. She said: &#8220;I felt like my life and world were out of control. But logging onto my little website and typing away on the computer keys gave me a sense of control. I couldn’t always do things that other kids had the energy to do. But I could get lost in writing for hours. I couldn’t control my life story, but I could write about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt it was like writing letters to her future self and would act as a reminder of how strong she had become. Even now when Allison writes on her website, she feels it is writing letters to her past self, expressing reassurance and pride. The practice of writing online continues to help her reflect on how she coped and made it through the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in the real world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison hoped her early experiences with hospitals and being unwell was just part of being a child, and that in adulthood she would be healthy. She longed for this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up did not bring her this dream of a healthier life and an end to chronic pain. In fact, her condition worsened as she went through her teens and at 18 she finally received a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison stood in front of trees\" class=\"wp-image-15290\" />Allison enjoying time with nature and trees\n\n\n\n<p>This changed what had been conventional job choices, as she was not able to handle a 9 to 5 work schedule. She could not drive herself to work on some days and relied on her mother to help with transport. She knew that she would have to find another way to work and she was determined to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began writing music and book reviews online, and then moved onto writing blog posts. As they were published she started to receive payment and a sense of power over her life. She said: &#8220;WordPress felt familiar, typing on the computer keys felt comfortable, and sharing my words with the world felt surreal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison&#8217;s sense of ownership of the software became part of her strength. &#8220;I think I believed WordPress was mine somehow. I was learning that WordPress is something that belongs to everyone in some way. And I loved it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The confidence using the platform gave Allison led her to find more about what it could do and meet other people who used it. She said: &#8220;The thing I love about WordPress is that it’s not just for developers or bloggers or SEO experts. I began to meet more people in the community and was delighted to find people like me, who didn’t know the technical stuff, but were a part of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This global community orbiting around the software gave her an opportunity to meet social media managers, designers, and people from many different areas. She found that &#8216;there was a place for everyone&#8217;. The guiding strength and fascination Allison found and still finds today is in that community. Allison said: &#8220;The community felt as important as the rest of everything that makes WordPress what it is. It felt like it was about people and relationships as well as codes and databases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, she was hired by a WordPress company. She said: &#8220;I like being a part of a WordPress company, and I love that I contribute to a team that helps people with their websites. I understand the importance of having a space that’s yours. Whether it’s a business or personal site, having a website gives you the power of telling your own story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Allison a freedom and an independence. She did not have to work a 9 to 5 job, rely on others to drive her on bad days with her MS, nor worry about days when she wanted to stay in her sweatshirts rather than go into an office to work. She said: &#8220;I have a 100% remote job which I can do despite the plot twists in my story, thanks to WordPress and the people in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress took Allison into the world of project management for a small agency, and this experience was to help guide her path, skills and confidence into the future. She went on to work in content management in WordPress, building pages for awareness campaigns for non profit organizations and small businesses as a contractor. She helps people update their websites, add and edit content, perform basic updates and help them to learn how to use their sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I tell all my clients to use WordPress because there is really no other solution that can scale as easily for growing organizations and small businesses. I love how WordPress allows them to tell their stories, share their passion, and have a place to call their own on the internet.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fluent English and Italian speaker, Allison is able to support clients in different countries from where she lives. &#8220;I love that with WordPress I&#8217;m able to support clients remotely. This is thanks to all of the many WordPress contributors, developers, project managers, content writers, and many, many volunteers that work tirelessly to enable people around the world to use WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison also became a certified as an English As A Second Language (ESL) teacher. &#8220;My affinity for words and languages allows me to teach passionately and creatively. I’m Italian-American and am fluent in English and Italian. Teaching English allows me to share my passion for communication with others.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcomed into the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/WPCoffeeTalk-Allie-Dye.png?resize=1024%2C562&ssl=1\" alt=\"Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-15293\" />Allie interviewed for a podcast on her use of WordPress\n\n\n\n<p>Allison attributes mentors and supporters in the WordPress community for helping her appreciate she really is part of it. Allison recalled: &#8220;It felt unreal. I wasn’t a dev, I don’t know how to code, and yet I got to be a part of it all? I felt like I was a fake. But Kimberly continues to remind me that I’m real, I get to be here, I get to stay, I have a place.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was later encouraged to contribute by a WordPress community member to the Big Orange Heart, which aims to support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities. She said she felt &#8216;honored typing my words, pieces of my story, and sharing them with a community of people&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also joined the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US 2021</a> online organizing team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison enjoys the fact that in the WordPress community, &#8216;everyone here is constantly working to be better and do better&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Facing the future with strength from her friends and colleagues in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"675\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-1.jpg?resize=675%2C900&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15289\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allison was later diagnosed with two additional neurological conditions: Functional Neurological Disorder and Migraine. She said: &#8220;If it were not for WordPress I would really be unable to work. But WordPress and its community continue to be a part of my life and I am grateful to everyone who&#8217;s helped me along my way. I don&#8217;t know where I would even be without it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She strives to raise awareness of dynamic disabilities and invisible illnesses like her own through podcasts and social media. She feels that her WordPress friends have helped her both in her professional life and in her wish to be an advocate for others with disabilities too.<br /><br />Allison hopes reading of her experience will help others who are worried about not progressing in a WordPress career due to health concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I hope that it will remind anyone reading this that WordPress is a space for everyone. Healthy or not, developer or not, blogger or not — WordPress belongs to you too.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Allie Dye (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/allisondye/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>allisondye</a>)&nbsp;for sharing about her adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Props to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>) and the late Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>) for interviews and writing the feature, Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>) for work on images, and to Meher, Maja Loncan (@mloncar) and Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>) for reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>People of WordPress</em>&nbsp;series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

No coding skills required!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the whole event, there will also be ample time for networking and meeting other WordPress enthusiasts. Getting to meet and learn from other WordPress users face-to-face is one of the main reasons people attend WordCamps. In addition to learning from each other, attendees often make new friends and find employees/employers from the WordCamp crowd.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finland.wordcamp.org/2023/tickets/\">Secure your tickets</a> now and ensure you’ll get to experience all of the insightful talks and activities with a welcoming community!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of speakers, session descriptions and schedule will be published in early August, so make sure to follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordcampfinland\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordCampFinland\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordcamp-finland\">Linkedin</a> to get the latest updates.

The release leads opted to skip Beta 1, which was delayed yesterday after some technical issues with packaging the release, and have moved straight on to Beta 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress 6.3 is set to be the last major release of the Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 2 focus on customization, it ties up many loose ends related to the Site Editor and usability in general.

I had the pleasure of visiting El Teide.\nSpain´s highest mountain  @(3718m) is one of the best places in the world to photograph the stars and is also the location of Teide Observatories, considered to be one of the world´s best observatories. \n\nThe goal was to capture the beautiful Milky Way galaxy along with one of the most amazing mountains I know El Teide. I have to say this was one of the most exhausting trips I have done. There was a lot of hiking at high altitudes and probably less than 10 hours of sleep in total for the whole week. Having been here 10-11 times before I had a long list of must-see locations I wanted to capture for this movie, but I am still not 100% used to carrying around so much gear required for time-lapse movies.\n \nA large sandstorm hit the Sahara Desert on the 9th April (http://bit.ly/g3tsDW) and at approx 3am in the night the sandstorm hit me, making  it nearly impossible to see the sky with my own eyes.\n\nInterestingly enough my camera was set for a 5 hour sequence of the milky way during this time and I was sure my whole scene was ruined. To my surprise, my camera had managed to capture the sandstorm which was backlit by Grand Canary Island making it look like golden clouds. The Milky Way was shining through the clouds, making the stars sparkle in an interesting way. So if you ever wondered how the Milky Way would look through a Sahara sandstorm, look at 00:32.\n\nAvailable in Digital Cinema 4k.\n\nFollow Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TSOPhotography\nFollow Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/TSOPhotography\nFollow Google+:\nhttps://plus.google.com/107543460658107759808\n\nPress/licensing/projects contact: tsophotography@gmail.com\n\n\nMusic by my friend: Ludovico Einaudi - \"Nuvole bianche\" with permission. \nPlease support the artist here:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/una-mattina/id217799399\";s:13:\"thumbnail_url\";s:113:\"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/145027281-cf3e3e047a52e2210b26bbcf42fcde909a80a7dd023a757b95af01936d065ec0-d_295x166\";s:15:\"thumbnail_width\";i:295;s:16:\"thumbnail_height\";i:166;s:30:\"thumbnail_url_with_play_button\";s:231:\"https://i.vimeocdn.com/filter/overlay?src0=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F145027281-cf3e3e047a52e2210b26bbcf42fcde909a80a7dd023a757b95af01936d065ec0-d_295x166&src1=http%3A%2F%2Ff.vimeocdn.com%2Fp%2Fimages%2Fcrawler_play.png\";s:11:\"upload_date\";s:19:\"2011-04-15 08:35:35\";s:8:\"video_id\";i:22439234;s:3:\"uri\";s:16:\"/videos/22439234\";}', 'no'),

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intro music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have with me Alex Kirk, who is a longtime WordPress contributor and who has been instrumental in recent innovations in the Polyglots&#8217; work. Phase four of the Gutenberg project is native multilingual support, and so I see this work that is being done as instrumental, not only for our global community but in support of what&#8217;s to come in that specific roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:00:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without further ado, Alex Kirk, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, how are you doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. Can you, let&#8217;s, because I bet that not a lot of people know who you are, can you first start by just telling me a bit about your work with WordPress, and then let us know what GlotPress is, for those of us who don&#8217;t know yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, Automattic sponsors me to work in the WordPress project on the Meta team and on the Polyglots team. So I spent time on improving or helping improve the software that powers the translation on WordPress.org. But I also work on the meta team on things like Matrix and evaluating if it would be a good fit for WordPress to switch to Matrix for their chat system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:01:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of really big projects that you work on, all of that kind of stuff that has no easy solutions anymore, is where you are right now. Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:01:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s no clear path, but it&#8217;s our mission to find it. So that&#8217;s part of what makes things interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So for folks who don&#8217;t know too much about the Polyglots team or generally translating WordPress, the software, can you let us know a bit about what GlotPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:02:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the translation system that powers WordPress.org is called GlotPress. It used to be a standalone software that was developed a couple of years ago, and it was transformed into a WordPress plugin at some point, and now powers the translation that happens on WordPress.org. So we translate WordPress core there from English to other languages, plugins, themes, block patterns, and it all happens through this software called GlotPress. There are a couple GlotPress installations around the world, but I think the WordPress.org one is one of the bigger ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:02:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably, WordPress.org is pretty, pretty massive. Also, I think it&#8217;s great that you said that GlotPress was created a couple of years ago, like that, that indicates to me that you&#8217;re working on a really different timescale than a lot of folks are in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:03:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Alex, tell me a little bit about what it takes to ship translated WordPress software. So, I mean, for people who don&#8217;t need translated WordPress, like obviously we don&#8217;t have a good idea of what it takes to make sure that WordPress is available in so many languages. So what goes into the work of making sure that that happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so typically the WordPress software and plugins and themes are primarily created in English. And for it to be available in other languages, it needs to be translated. And for that to be able to happen, the programmers need to make the software translatable. Basically, they&#8217;re providing each English string for the translation software to be available to be transformed, so to speak, into another language and to what it&#8217;s being transformed to. This is what the translators do. So they go into the GlotPress software and see the list of texts that need to be translated and translate it to their language that they speak. Typically there is a process around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:03:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got people who have lots of experience in translation. And specifically in translating WordPress or WordPress plugins. And they&#8217;re kind of the, the people who help ensure good quality of translation. So anybody who&#8217;s working the WordPress project, so basically who has a WordPress.org account, can come in and address the translation. And that translation enters the system, so to speak, in a waiting state. And then somebody who we promoted to be a Translation Editor will come along and take a look at your translation and will approve it or will give you suggestions how to do the translation in a better way, or come up with maybe even a better translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, when you have like a small thing that&#8217;s just not right, like a missing full stop or something like that. They might just add it for you. And well, as soon as the plugin or software is translated to a certain level of translations those translations will be shipped out to the WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, for a plugin, you would reach 90% of translated strings. Those translations will then be basically packed up into zip file, a language pack and delivered to each WordPress so that you can have the translations available there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is 90% the threshold for plugins only, or is that also the threshold for like themes and the CMS itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well. We strive for 100%, I would say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:05:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. <em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:05:48]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, 90% more of a motivational point. To be actually honest, I&#8217;m not sure if the threshold is 90% for every project or even if it&#8217;s actually 90%. It&#8217;s different between different GlotPress installations and it&#8217;s basically something that is made as a setting that can be changed. There&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an arbitrary number. Typically you&#8217;d actually want to make sure that the most important strings are translated first. So the ones like, if you look at the whole picture, software usually consists of many parts, many of whom are not encountered by people on a regular basis. For example, error messages that could be like obscure error messages, and you could argue that those might be not as important. Or even sometimes you could even say like, do they need to be translated? Because if you encounter an error message and you search the internet, wouldn&#8217;t you probably want everybody to search for the English one to find the solution? But that set-aside, it&#8217;s important to have like the headline of the plugin or like the most important strings translated, and typically translating those most important strings will take you to a pretty high percentage so that we can then say it&#8217;s good enough to be shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha. I see, I see. Okay. Well, we talked a bit earlier about GlotPress&#8217;s timeline. It has been around for a bit, I know. But with that kind of in mind, have there been any notable changes to GlotPress recently?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think for GlotPress there&#8217;s been a bit of an up and down over time in terms of engagement and progress on the software. But in, in the recent year, I think we&#8217;ve added a couple of things that have been very helpful for translators. So one of them was adding the commenting functionality, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:07:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super helpful. Shocked it wasn&#8217;t there before. Sorry, translators. Sorry, all of our polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:07:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can be like there was when GlotPress was created there, there is like the, a big part of GlotPress are these states, like the waiting state when you enter translation, and then there&#8217;s approved state, which basically a translation we say it&#8217;s set to current, and there&#8217;s all sorts of process around it. So if the software is updated or translation might get fuzzy. But also like, if somebody submits a translation that doesn&#8217;t fully conform to what&#8217;s the translation editors, or like what the standards of the translation community have been set to, then you would have to need to reject it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been something that we felt wasn&#8217;t a very good and enticing way of telling people like, we appreciate your work. It wasn&#8217;t just quite right, but it&#8217;s more of a rejection. So this is how we came up with this like, let&#8217;s give people the option to say what was wrong and give them a chance to try again without making them feel rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Sort of a &#8220;No, but&#8230;&#8221; as opposed to a, just refusal to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:08:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other things that we&#8217;ve worked on is, like, with the recent search of AI, like getting help from AI on translation and also on reviews. So, there&#8217;s some interesting things that you can do with AI in that regard; that one important aspect of translations, it&#8217;s also that we&#8217;ve got glossaries for each language where people, basically the translation community, identifies certain words they want to translate them the same way every time.&nbsp;And with the AI, you can basically add to the prompt, like, please translate those words to those translations when you give me a translation for that. And as it can change over time, you can always adapt this to the prompt, and that has been proven quite helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:09:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is great. That&#8217;s one of those things I know that AI has been like a really popular thing to talk about. And AI, specifically for translations, I think has caused some concern that maybe we&#8217;ll just like translate it all and hope that computers get it right when we know pretty certainly that computers don&#8217;t always get the translations right. But that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, right? What you&#8217;re suggesting is that AI would suggest what could be translated and what it could be translated to, and then human beings have to confirm that that&#8217;s correct, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:09:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly it. So basically, we give suggestions to the translators, and then they can modify a translation before they press save. It&#8217;s more of a, like supporting them in getting the translations, like looking up words more quickly and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:10:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s wonderful. So is that the major sort of next step that is coming for GlotPress, or are there other things that we should keep an eye out for in that software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:10:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one direction that we&#8217;ve been taking GlotPress is basically making use of the fact that GlotPress is WordPress plugin now. And you know, typically, you would just use a GlotPress install. So on WordPress.Org, there&#8217;s like GlotPress installed, there&#8217;s translation projects created, something that we call &#8220;translation sets&#8221;. So for languages, you want to translate it to, it&#8217;s all pre-configured, and if you would install GlotPress to plugin on your own WordPress, it would be empty and not very useful. So what we&#8217;ve added is a way for you to basically be able to translate the plugins and themes that you&#8217;ve got installed in your WordPress into the language that you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might have a non-English website that you want to use certain plugins with, and they might not be fully translated at this point, so obviously, you could go to WordPress.org and help translate them, and that&#8217;s the way to, that&#8217;s preferred. But you could also now go install GlotPress on your own website and translate there. And then you have the translations there right when you enter them. And you can then contribute those translations back to WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:11:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s with local GlotPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that we call local GlotPress. And you know, since we then have all these translations in the local database, it means we can do even more with those translations. So typically, language packs would be delivered to WordPress, but with local GlotPress, you&#8217;ve got like all the GlotPress software there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can do things like inline translation. So, on your own WordPress and wp-admin, for example, we can highlight all the strings that can be translated, and those strings just have to right-click them and enter your translation, and that way, you can basically go about and translate the whole ui, seeing your progress, as you&#8217;re making, basically turning the screen from red to green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:12:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s something now that you can do in your local WordPress installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:12:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s completely independent of WordPress.org. We would ask you to contribute the translations back when you have them, but being independent also allows you to translate like premium plugins, which could not be hosted on WordPress.org or doing something like that we call like hyper-local translation. So, for example, I speak Austrian German natively, but even inside Austria, we&#8217;ve got different dialects or like special words that we use. And if I wanted to create a website that&#8217;s targeted at the Viennese market, for example, I might want to use those specific terms. And this is something I would have to argue for those translations to be accepted on WordPress.org because it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s like a very targeted market. But if I have a local GlotPress, I can do those translations there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems awfully beneficial, especially as dialects. I&#8217;ve been having these conversations. I have, in my extended family, many children, and they are all learning languages and one of them has been having kind of thoughts about, like, dialects and how dialects are almost another language. And if so, like how do you know what everybody&#8217;s saying when you&#8217;re speaking all the same thing, but it&#8217;s kind of a little bit it sounds a little bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly a thing in the US, the distinct dialects across our country. And so I imagine that that&#8217;s gonna be a really beneficial sort of implementation for countries that have a lot of different regional variations and certainly smaller countries that have technically the same language as somebody else, but a lot of regional differences, regional specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:14:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same or different as the live translations, Translate Live, that we talked about at the WordCamp Europe a couple weeks back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:14:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, Translate Live is kind of the next step after local GlotPress. It&#8217;s like this happy marriage between the WordPress Playground and local GlotPress. So the WordPress Playground is also something that has come up a lot. It&#8217;s basically a way for you to run WordPress inside a browser window, so in JavaScript. And at first, it seems like mildly interesting, I would say. But when you combine it with other things like local GlotPress, it can lead to really interesting opportunities. So with inline translation, for example, on WordPress.org, you would typically find for every plugin, the UI would look the same. You would have a table of strings, and all that makes you realize you&#8217;re translating this certain plugin is that in the header of the page, it says this name of the plugin, but other than that, it can look really all the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, with WordPress Playground, you can put up a WordPress and run this plugin inside that Playground. And now, if you add local GlotPress to the picture, you can also do the inline translation of that plugin inside the WordPress Playground. So you&#8217;ve got inline translation. We add the glossary so they do make sure that you translate things the same way that they&#8217;re expected, and you don&#8217;t have to install the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:15:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And still, you can see what the translations will look like. You can see the strings next to each other, and what I think is most important, you will start with the strings that you see first, which are the most important ones. When you&#8217;re in the table view, those strings might be somewhere buried in the middle, and yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to see progress if you start with kind of obscure error messages, for example, versus just starting with the things that you see first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:16:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, moving translations away from table-based translations where you kind of have to know what you&#8217;re looking for. So the Translate Live, along with local GlotPress, along with WP Playground, is going to make it so that it&#8217;s easier to see visually what needs to be translated, where, what&#8217;s most valuable to translate for your mid users and your end users, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:16:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, and also like for plug-in authors, it can be really good to see, you know, you can switch the languages in the Playground to another language, and you can quickly see like what&#8217;s the state of the translation in this language or in that language. And even things like, you know, Arabic as an RTL language rights to left language. The sidebar will change to the right, and you can also just switch language and see like, what&#8217;s my plugin like in this environment. I mean, this is not technically something that&#8217;s related to local GlotPress, but in this translation live ui, it&#8217;s very easy to change languages and see your plugin in another language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not specifically related to, to Translations Live, but also, I think that if we&#8217;re saying that WordPress not necessarily is going to lead the way with translations and native multilingual support in our CMS because, of course, it&#8217;s still a little bit far out on our roadmap. We certainly have an opportunity to have the best implementation of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:17:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if like that specific use case that you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t related directly to what it is that you are working on for Polyglots and inside GlotPress and all of that, I do see that having more streamlined, more easy to see and access opportunities to like test the way that our software looks across varying environments, especially those that change it substantially from what we typically work in day-to-day for any individual developer or any individual WordPress site implementer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:00</strong>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I think that that is a big step forward for all of us and certainly for anyone who is having to use WordPress as not a native English speaker. And so you say it&#8217;s not related, but it still is a big, a big benefit for WordPress overall, I think, to have this kind of work happening so that we can have those benefits to the folks who are using our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:18:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there were a couple of different things that you mentioned over the course of our conversation. We&#8217;re gonna put some links to the show notes for all of those. But one thing that you mentioned that just kind of went by, and we never really had an opportunity to talk about it. You talked about the, I think it was GTEs, Global Translation Editors, the folks that are like approved as final approvers of translations. If there is someone who&#8217;s listening to this podcast who wants to become a GTE someday, where would they go to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the path to GTE is a PTE.&nbsp;<em>( laughs )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:18:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve got different levels of translation editors. Basically, you start, you could say you start off as a translator, and this is how you can kind of show that you can do good translations or that you&#8217;re very firm in your language. And this might make you be noticed in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:16]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re always looking for people who like to help with translations. And you might be then promoted to be a Project Translation Editor. Basically, it means that for a single language in a project, you&#8217;ll be able to approve translations. So, you&#8217;ll be the one who says, like, this translation is a good one and this conforms to the to the rules that we have stated as a translation community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:19:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further down the path then is the GTE, where you basically are allowed to approve translations across any project on translate.WordPress.org in your language. And that&#8217;s, usually you&#8217;ll be in, in that position with other GTEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is, like, in each community, there is like, we&#8217;re people based. We talk about what might be a good translation. We talk to each other, try to find rules that maybe prevent common mistranslations, or set the standards for how we want the software to be translated. And this is something where you get a voice as a translator, but as a GTE, you get into a position where you can actually make the changes or find consensus on how the software should be translated in your language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:35]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if folks are not familiar where the Polyglots team works and meets, where would they find you all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:41]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At make.WordPress.org/polyglots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Alex, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Kirk&nbsp; 00:20:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>( Intermission music )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:20:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things. First, WP Campus 2023 is taking place July 12th through the 14th. That&#8217;s a nonprofit three-day conference with topics that focus on the growth of higher education, accessibility, WordPress, and anyone who works in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a hybrid event. There is an in-person component on the beautiful campus of Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I&#8217;ll add information about that in our show notes for anyone who would like to join in person or online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that the mentorship program pilot that I have been talking about a little bit over the last few months has been formally launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in contributing more to the project but not sure where to begin, take a look at this comprehensive onboarding experience. It&#8217;s cohort-based. It has some personalized one-to-one mentorship. There are guided courses, live workshops, all of that. So read more about it in our show notes and sign up for one-on-one team mentorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:21:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, finally, Matt mentioned at WordCamp Europe an idea that he had been thinking of for some time a Make team dashboard that would sort of help define team metrics and help identify for individual contributors what should indicate team health and where they can find the most impactful projects to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A post has since been published on make.WordPress.org/meta calling for additional feedback on that idea, so that we have an understanding of what this could be, how the dashboard can kind of come to be. And so stop by and add your thoughts there in the comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; 00:22:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Her parents gave her own WordPress website to use, play, test, and try whatever she wanted with it. Her health issues had started when she was eight years old, and being able to express who she was and learn new skills provided an escape she needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first encounter with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison said: &#8220;While the technical aspects of my new WordPress website intrigued me, I was more interested in the space it made for me to write. All throughout my childhood I had struggled with chronic pain, fatigue, and other unexplained symptoms. Having a private world I could call my own, I was able to write my story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;There is something truly amazing about having a place to tell your story.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Allison Dye</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her family faced many doctors, nurse, specialists and hospital visits, but could not get an answer to the difficulties faced by Allison. She said: &#8220;I felt like my life and world were out of control. But logging onto my little website and typing away on the computer keys gave me a sense of control. I couldn’t always do things that other kids had the energy to do. But I could get lost in writing for hours. I couldn’t control my life story, but I could write about it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt it was like writing letters to her future self and would act as a reminder of how strong she had become. Even now when Allison writes on her website, she feels it is writing letters to her past self, expressing reassurance and pride. The practice of writing online continues to help her reflect on how she coped and made it through the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in the real world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison hoped her early experiences with hospitals and being unwell was just part of being a child, and that in adulthood she would be healthy. She longed for this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up did not bring her this dream of a healthier life and an end to chronic pain. In fact, her condition worsened as she went through her teens and at 18 she finally received a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Allison stood in front of trees\" class=\"wp-image-15290\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/06/allison-2.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Allison enjoying time with nature and trees</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This changed what had been conventional job choices, as she was not able to handle a 9 to 5 work schedule. She could not drive herself to work on some days and relied on her mother to help with transport. She knew that she would have to find another way to work and she was determined to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began writing music and book reviews online, and then moved onto writing blog posts. As they were published she started to receive payment and a sense of power over her life. She said: &#8220;WordPress felt familiar, typing on the computer keys felt comfortable, and sharing my words with the world felt surreal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison&#8217;s sense of ownership of the software became part of her strength. &#8220;I think I believed WordPress was mine somehow. I was learning that WordPress is something that belongs to everyone in some way. And I loved it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding work with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The confidence using the platform gave Allison led her to find more about what it could do and meet other people who used it. She said: &#8220;The thing I love about WordPress is that it’s not just for developers or bloggers or SEO experts. I began to meet more people in the community and was delighted to find people like me, who didn’t know the technical stuff, but were a part of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This global community orbiting around the software gave her an opportunity to meet social media managers, designers, and people from many different areas. She found that &#8216;there was a place for everyone&#8217;. The guiding strength and fascination Allison found and still finds today is in that community. Allison said: &#8220;The community felt as important as the rest of everything that makes WordPress what it is. It felt like it was about people and relationships as well as codes and databases.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, she was hired by a WordPress company. She said: &#8220;I like being a part of a WordPress company, and I love that I contribute to a team that helps people with their websites. I understand the importance of having a space that’s yours. Whether it’s a business or personal site, having a website gives you the power of telling your own story.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Allison a freedom and an independence. She did not have to work a 9 to 5 job, rely on others to drive her on bad days with her MS, nor worry about days when she wanted to stay in her sweatshirts rather than go into an office to work. She said: &#8220;I have a 100% remote job which I can do despite the plot twists in my story, thanks to WordPress and the people in it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress took Allison into the world of project management for a small agency, and this experience was to help guide her path, skills and confidence into the future. She went on to work in content management in WordPress, building pages for awareness campaigns for non profit organizations and small businesses as a contractor. She helps people update their websites, add and edit content, perform basic updates and help them to learn how to use their sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I tell all my clients to use WordPress because there is really no other solution that can scale as easily for growing organizations and small businesses.

00:00:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your guest host Chloé Bringmann. And here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have the privilege of guest hosting this episode of the WordPress Briefing. And today I have with me a very special guest. The Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, Angela Jin. Welcome. Before we dive into all the questions, can you tell me and our listeners a little bit about your role in the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, happy to, and thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m very excited to be here. I am the Head of Programs and Contributor Experience, and I provide oversight and guidance for our WordPress programs, such as our events programs, training, and Five for the Future, with an eye toward ensuring their sustainability and growth. I&#8217;m very fortunate to work with our contributors across many teams around the world. In addition to troubleshooting and helping folks figure out how to move forward, I also spend a good amount of time exploring with others what could be in our programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:01:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just got back from WordCamp Europe in Athens, Greece. It was such an energizing event for me, but I&#8217;m curious about what your impressions were of the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:01:52]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was fantastic. I&#8217;m always really inspired by what a group of like-minded people can achieve together. There&#8217;s a lot of passion for this particular WordCamp, and it made for a really wonderful WordPress experience. Full of lots of great connections and memories; I have a million follow-ups and probably even more thoughts to reflect on. So it&#8217;s great. There were a lot of new WordPressers there. So it was lovely to meet them. And I&#8217;m really excited to see how many exciting new projects and ideas that we have in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:02:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same, you said it perfectly. Josepha also mentioned in the flagship’s keynote, the proposal for the next generation of WordCamps. I&#8217;m curious about what the main ideas and goals, as discussed thus far, are of that proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:02:42]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. So WordCamps have been fundamental for the WordPress community for a very long time. And while they have continued to grow larger and reach more places around the world, it&#8217;s also undeniable that the way that people meet has changed since 2006.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:01]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, just as WordPress itself iterates we&#8217;re looking at iterating on WordCamps so that they move from fundamental to indispensable for the WordPressers of today and tomorrow. So event attendees today are looking to learn essential skills, make connections that lead to neat opportunities, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to that end, we put forth an updated purpose for our events, which is that WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:03:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal here is to create events that are more clearly defined &#8211; who these are for what you will gain from attending. We are looking to see events that take a deeper dive into content, or topics and provide more advanced content. And let&#8217;s try out some different formats and see how that shapes our event experience. And so it is a big shift. And change is always hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the feedback that I&#8217;ve gotten so far, and certainly at WordCamp Europe, is that this is a very welcome evolution. And the Community team has already received over 60 proposals. So I&#8217;m very excited about that. In fact, a WordPress Community Day in Rome has already been announced and is focused on providing meet-up organizing and community management skills. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Chloé Bringmann 00:04:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s incredible. I love that we&#8217;ve gotten 60 suggestions already and that we already have an event in place. That&#8217;s fantastic. In that blog post, too, it&#8217;s mentioned that WordCamps should prioritize inclusivity and diversity. How can organizers ensure these values are upheld in the next generation of WordCamps and beyond events? Into our day-to-day project involvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:04]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent question. So while WordCamps themselves are changing, some of our core values, like prioritizing inclusivity and diversity, are non-negotiable. For the whole project, we have a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement, and a Code of Conduct that lays out how we expect our community to engage with each other in this space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of that, our programs do focus on providing resources and training like how to create a diverse speaker roster. And we have diverse speaker training workshops on how to organize a diverse and inclusive WordPress event. And we also have a great list of third-party resources as well. And so, with so many events, we create a lot of opportunities to grow as a visible contributor, whether it is a speaker, a volunteer, or an organizer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:05:56]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with the next generation of events, we could more intentionally create these spaces for groups that historically have been underrepresented. Even long before my post went live, the BlackPress meetup group, for example, wanted to create an event that connected with historically black colleges and universities. And an event like that that really invites a specific group to learn all about WordPress would be a really great experience and a wonderful way to celebrate that community and a great connection to the broader community so that we can intentionally get to the diversity that we want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:06:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want to add that the people who are underrepresented in our community are more likely to need financial sponsorship. And so even though we do keep our ticket prices low so that our events are more easily accessible, the cost of travel continues to increase, not to mention the time and energy required to participate in these events. So an excellent way that companies can help is to sponsor somebody&#8217;s time and somebody&#8217;s contributions, which we&#8217;re always trying to encourage through the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:07:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. So, with that in mind, how do you foresee the next generation of WordCamps impacting the WordPress community, that larger ecosystem? So, what changes do you hope to see regarding community engagement, learning opportunities, and best practices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I foresee us evolving our tried and true event format into a dynamic wealth of community-led opportunities. I know that online events were pretty exhausting during the worst of the pandemic, but there is a ton of unexplored opportunities there. And community research is also showing that online is a great way to create more inclusive and diverse events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:07:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training team, with their learn WordPress online workshops, have really led the way with our online events. And there are so many more people that we can reach there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:08]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in addition to providing more advanced content, I also hope to see content around broader tech and business trends that influence WordPress, and conversely, how WordPress can shape those trends as well. And with all of that, I really hope that we can bring in more community members that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what we currently offer, especially a younger generation that will help us drive the next generation of WordPress, the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:08:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very excited to hear all of this, and I bet our listeners are too. I&#8217;m curious how they and community members can provide feedback or get involved with this next generation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:08:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to encourage everyone, please come chat with the Community team and comment on the current posts. We really welcome your feedback to help us get our events to this next iteration of what they will become. There are two posts, in particular, one is to suggest ideas of event formats and topics that you would like to see. And the second is if you are an organizer, we&#8217;re inviting you to hear some recommendations for improved tooling that would be helpful for your event site. And we&#8217;ll include links to those posts in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:09:26]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One final question for you, Angela. Any thoughts as we prepare for WordCamp US and the Community Summit, which will be in National Harbor, Maryland, in August?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Community Summit in particular, if you want to attend and you haven&#8217;t already applied, please please do make sure to apply as soon as possible. And encourage somebody else who you think should attend to apply as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:09:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if financial constraints are a blocker, we are aiming to help with the cost of hotel and or flight. And so one way to help support the diversity and inclusion of this event, and really to the whole project, is to also contribute to the Community Summit travel fund. You can find information about all of that on the Community Summit site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Angela Jin 00:10:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next, if you have a topic in mind that you think needs to be discussed at the Community Summit, please please also share that information with us as well. And last but not least, I am, I am so excited. I&#8217;m not going to spoil anything. But I have been working with the WordCamp US organizing team and looking at some of what they have planned and some of the content. It&#8217;s going to be a truly incredible event, so don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:41]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for joining me, Angela. And I can&#8217;t wait to see you and the WordPress community in August in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:010:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is the proposal and establishment of a new WordPress contributor team, the Sustainability team. Coming into WordCamp Europe, a proposal was put forward to create a team that would embed sustainable practices and processes in the ecosystem to ensure the Project&#8217;s longevity, both socially, economically, and as well environmentally. At WordCamp Europe, this proposal was confirmed, and the Sustainability team is now officially the 22nd contributor team that WordPressers can support with their contributions. Head on over to their making WordPress Slack channel, #sustainability, and join the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:011:39]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I would like to call your attention to the 6.4 development cycle post that was published on June 5th. 6.4 will be the third major release of 2023 and supports our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by being led by those contributors that identify as underrepresented gender. This release will also be the first to kick off phase three of the Gutenberg roadmap, which is collaborative editing and workflows. I&#8217;ve included a link to the post in our show notes and encourage anyone who is interested in being part of this momentous release to join us in making this both impactful and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Chloé Bringmann 00:012:16]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, WordCamp US, as discussed, will be upon us before we know it starting on August 24th at National Harbor, Maryland. While tickets may be sold out, volunteers are still very much needed to make the flagship event run smoothly. So stop by us.wordcamp.org, raise your hand, and join us in August for engagement, inspiration, and learning. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

More than 2,500 individuals from 94 countries came together in person or through the live stream to participate in a remarkable three-day event (plus Contributor Day) filled with talks, networking, and learning opportunities. The event concluded on June 10 with a captivating keynote address by WordPress co-founder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, and Gutenberg Product Architect <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a>, who highlighted the advancements and upcoming milestones of the WordPress Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant update shared during the keynote was the successful reactivation of WordCamps. This time last year, we organized eight in-person WordCamps, and by the end of 2022, the number had risen to 23. Thanks to the enthusiasm and involvement of the WordPress community, we are already on track to organize 25 WordCamps in the first half of this year alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha also emphasized the importance of the upcoming Community Summit on August 22-23. This in-person gathering brings contributors together across the WordPress open source project, fostering cross-project discussions vital for future growth and sustainability.

She also underscored the expansion of the WordPress ecosystem, citing examples like <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a>, which now provides access to nearly 800 million images and audio files, all easily accessible in the Site Editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting addition to the WordPress repertoire is <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/\">WP Playground</a>. This new feature allows users to build WordPress applications instantly in the browser without needing a PHP server. This tool provides a swift and seamless experience, reducing the installation time from five minutes to a near-instantaneous 500 milliseconds. The application of WP Playground may seem like magic, but its practical application promises tangible and revolutionary benefits for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías Ventura then took the stage to share updates on Gutenberg. Through a visually stunning video built entirely with blocks, he showcased the six-year development journey and the transition from words to blocks to a final design. The upcoming WordPress version 6.3 will mark the completion of the first two phases of Gutenberg, consolidating all these features into a cohesive and user-friendly experience. He also highlighted the introduction of features such as the Wayfinder tool, Style Book, and the ability to save patterns, further empowering users to own their web presence and voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote presentation, the WordPress leadership engaged in a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzKiKRodHQ0\"> lively Q&amp;A session </a>with the audience, further illustrating the continuous evolution within the WordPress Project. This session highlighted how the WordPress community innovates, iterates, and continually improves to create a better platform for today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzKiKRodHQ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global community and be part of the WordPress journey toward a brighter future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a> and <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>eidolonnight</a> for review and collaboration</em>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"15167\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"The Month in WordPress – May 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 10:15:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=15100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:350:\"May has been a month of celebrating WordPress and the open source community that makes it possible.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro music)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this year, there has been a lot of research and examination of the contributor funnel in the WordPress community. That research confirms some assumptions about what most contributor stories have in common: the hurdles, the general paths taken, and the way that problem-solving was done. Then in February of this year, Hari Shanker published a proposal for a mentorship program for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we&#8217;ve got a pilot program that&#8217;s been defined and is waiting for your feedback. If you&#8217;ve not read the post about the contributor mentorship program, for one do it. But if you would rather hear a synopsis from me, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m about to give you a 10-cent tour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, who is doing this? This pilot program has been outlined by a community working group. We often have working groups in WordPress, and they almost always have specific projects around events or programs, or code updates. Since this working group is focused on a project-wide program, there is project-wide representation in it. All the names are at the bottom of the post, which you can find in our show notes. But it&#8217;s got folks who contribute with code or contribute with time or contribute with design folks who are self-sponsored or corporately sponsored, just a nice mix of people. The program as a whole, though, is being stewarded by Hari Shankar, a longtime supporter of and contributor to WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next, what is this for? There are a few goals for the program. But the overarching goal is to increase the success of new contributors over time. We can all agree that if we were to have 1000s of new contributors every day, but they couldn&#8217;t find their way to impactful contributions or meaningful connections quickly, then we would have done them a disservice. And they probably won&#8217;t continue to be part of the community without a bit more effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The when and the where are essentially “right now and right here,” so that brings us finally to Why. Why are we doing this mentorship program? Apart from to help people who want to contribute have an easier path to success – which frankly is enough of a reason anyway – the why is wrapped up in our overall philosophies in the project. If we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere and that contributions of any size matter. And that open source is an idea that can change our generation and that we are democratizing publishing, then bringing new people brings new ideas, and beginner contributions can grow over time. We can maintain this idea, this concept of open source, into the next generation and to future generations. And always keep our sights on the open web. To learn more about this and other project-wide initiatives, swing by make.wordpress.org/project or check the links in today&#8217;s show notes on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:56]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First on the list is WordCamp Europe. That&#8217;s coming up at the end of the week on June 8 through 10th in Athens, Greece. There will be a major update from Matt and friends, so even if you aren&#8217;t there in person, keep an eye out for those recordings. But for those who are there and you&#8217;re curious about the mentorship program or anything else to do with WordPress and contributing to the project, you can come find me or Angela Jin, Hari will also be there, Chloé will be there, Héctor will be there, lots of people, and we want to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is a call for brainpower! A call for your brainstorms! On the subject of the next generation, we&#8217;ve got a discussion going on about the next generation of WordCamps. We&#8217;ve been discussing what new types and varieties might be available, and that might make sense for people as we get back to in-person events. So if you&#8217;ve got a kind of WordCamp that you&#8217;ve been desperately wanting to try, now&#8217;s the time to let folks know about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is the second volume of The WordPress history book called Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress is now available for download in several formats as well as on GitHub. Stop buy, give it a read, and relive some of the highlights of the past ten years of the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>—somewhat similar to LEGO bricks—that you can move around and interact with. Move your cursor around and you’ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text block</strong> the most basic block of all. The text block has its own controls to be moved freely around the post&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">&#8230; like this one, which is right aligned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headings are separate blocks as well, which helps with the outline and organization of your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Handling images and media with the utmost care is a primary focus of the new editor. Hopefully, you’ll find aspects of adding captions or going full-width with your pictures much easier and robust than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter wp-duotone-default-filter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cldup.com/cXyG__fTLN.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful landscape\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">If your theme supports it, you’ll see the &#8220;wide&#8221; button on the image toolbar. Give it a try.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Try selecting and removing or editing the caption, now you don’t have to be careful about selecting the image or other text by mistake and ruining the presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The <em>Inserter</em> Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the same place on the interface. No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember complicated shortcode syntax. That’s the spirit behind the inserter—the <code>(+)</code> button you’ll see around the editor—which allows you to browse all available content blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already add into your posts that you didn’t know about. Here’s a short list of what you can currently find there:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Text &amp; Headings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Images &amp; Videos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galleries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Embeds, like YouTube, Tweets, or other WordPress posts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Layout blocks, like Buttons, Hero Images, Separators, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And <em>Lists</em> like this one of course 🙂</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Visual Editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge benefit of blocks is that you can edit them in place and manipulate your content directly. Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.</p>\n<cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. It’s always easy to add it back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to add a subdued quote as part of the composition of your text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-duotone-default-filter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cldup.com/n0g6ME5VKC.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-duotone-default-filter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cldup.com/ZjESfxPI3R.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-duotone-default-filter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cldup.com/EKNF8xD2UM.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can change the amount of columns in your galleries by dragging a slider in the block inspector in the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Media Rich</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>full-wide</strong> alignments with galleries, you can create a very media rich layout, very quickly:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull wp-duotone-default-filter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cldup.com/8lhI-gKnI2.jpg\" alt=\"Accessibility is important — don’t forget image alt attribute\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big. But sometimes the image is worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-duotone-default-filter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cldup.com/_rSwtEeDGD.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large wp-duotone-default-filter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cldup.com/L-cC3qX2DN.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above is a gallery with just two images. It’s an easier way to create visually appealing layouts, without having to deal with floats. You can also easily convert the gallery back to individual images again, by using the block switcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any block can opt into these alignments. The embed block has them also, and is responsive out of the box:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Mountain\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/22439234?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can build any block you like, static or dynamic, decorative or plain.

Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source.

Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already add into your posts that you didn’t know about. Here’s a short list of what you can currently find there:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Text &amp; Headings</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Images &amp; Videos</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Galleries</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Embeds, like YouTube, Tweets, or other WordPress posts.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Layout blocks, like Buttons, Hero Images, Separators, etc.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>And <em>Lists</em> like this one of course :)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator {\"opacity\":\"css\"} -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Visual Editing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A huge benefit of blocks is that you can edit them in place and manipulate your content directly. Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. It’s always easy to add it back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to add a subdued quote as part of the composition of your text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"columns\":2,\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped\"><!-- wp:image {\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/n0g6ME5VKC.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/ZjESfxPI3R.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/EKNF8xD2UM.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can change the amount of columns in your galleries by dragging a slider in the block inspector in the sidebar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Media Rich</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>full-wide</strong> alignments with galleries, you can create a very media rich layout, very quickly:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"full\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/8lhI-gKnI2.jpg\" alt=\"Accessibility is important — don’t forget image alt attribute\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big.
